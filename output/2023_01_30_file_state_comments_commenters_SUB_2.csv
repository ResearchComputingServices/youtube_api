19,UgxY-HbgIfeI3r3VKEp4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E,"Of all the depictions of the founding of Rome, the most interesting and unique of all would be the one shown in Steven Saylor's novel ""Rome"". Unlike many other adaptations, in which Romulus and Remus are portrayed as two brave men who founded Rome for the survival of their people, in this novel both brothers are just immature brats whose actions are motivated by pure fun. At first, both youngsters spend the day dressed as wolves and playing pranks on the inhabitants of the village where they live. When their pranks end up causing King Amulius to imprison Remus and Romulus had to rescue him by killing the ruler, the two brothers realize how much fun it is to conquer other towns. With the help of their group of followers, who are also immature kids, Romulus and Remus decide to start attacking other villages and also decide to turn their own home into a city, just to ""know what might come of it"". Even after creating Rome and killing Remus, Romulus, already as king, continues with his immature attitude and decides to organize the Rapture of the Sabines, not to repopulate the city, but to troll the Sabines and have a good laugh at them. However, Romulus ends up paying for his impertinence when, after 40 years reigning, the senators get fed up with his carefree attitude and assassinate him. Literally, if this Romulus had seen what the city he created would end up becoming long after his death, he would have said: ""It was just a prank, bros...""  emoji_crying_face "

Because all your imperial idea is going to collapse. So you try to make fake Greeks civilization (they have no culture /civilization to make their own alphabets) . Etruscans had their own alphabets (this affets Romans and they borrowed it from them and create Latin language)  that there are 6 lettters as same as Göktürk alphabet (Orhun monuments, about 5-6 centuries) , and there are 2 of them only in Gökturk and Etruscans alphabet."

Greece tried to make everyone Hellenistic. Persia is the only empire that did not destroy other cultures or religions, it respected all. Therefore they are glorified in the Bible and Greece and Rome r not. When Persia defeated Babylon they allowed the defeated king to remain in power, they kept Babylonian customs. Babylon had to only pay taxes in return. They did the same with Egypt etc. Alexander did the opposite he tried to make Egypt Hellenistic. Similar to what Arabs did to many parts of Middle East, or what Anglo saxons did to native Americans, enforce their culture and annihilate what they encounter. Persia never did that. They respected others, ppl were free under Persian rule. This was not the case within Greek city states. So the idea of evil Persians trying to destroy Greece is laughable. Alexander did more destruction to Greece than the Persians. Look up destruction of Thebes. by modern standards Persia was far ahead everyone incl. ancient Greece in terms of religious freedom (the Jews loved Persia) human rights, women rights, labor rights etc. It would take the rest of the world 2500 years to catch up.But u continue to live in your fairy tale. western distortion of history will be exposed.

62,Ugy8Q-6m9cYd8ElnEYV4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy LEGEND AND REALITYThe name Roma derives from the Etruscan name Ruma , an ancient goddess who had the ficus ruminalis as an attribute , sacred because the not yet ripe fig has a liquid similar to milk. The Pythagoreans also worshiped the fig fruit they carried in procession. In fact, a fig tree was perpetually at the foot of the Palatine. In short, the first Rome of the seven kings was above all Etruscan.The legend tells that Romulus and Remus were suckled under the fig tree, in reality the suckling fig comes from the Goddess Ruma to whom a small temple was dedicated next to the fig. Ruma or Rumina was the Etruscan-Roman goddess of infant feeding, to whom only libations of milk were dedicated.The name Ruma in fact means "" breast""and, like so many Etruscan names, turning into Latin they transform the"" u ""into"" o ""like the word"" rumax ""which becomes"" romanus ""in Latin. Thus Ruma becomes Rome.The legend tells that the two twins Romulus and Remus, abandoned in a basket on the Tiber river, they were suckled by a she-wolf who will in fact be the symbol of Rome. But the Goddess Lupa was also an ancient divinity, later assimilated to Acca Larentia, who was not a woman but the Goddess LupaIn its rites the priestesses practiced sacred prostitution, or ""hierodulia"" imitating the verse of the she-wolf. On the other hand, the goddess of Etruscan fertility ""Feronia"", venerated at the foot of Mount Soratte, in Lucus Feroniae, by Latini, Sabini and Falisci, was a she-wolf goddess.In ancient Rome, the derogatory term ""she-wolf"" remained to indicate a prostitute, the term ""brothel"" for brothels and the cry of the wolf that Roman prostitutes, no longer sacred, made to lure patrons.Acca Larentia was therefore not a woman, as the patriarchate tells, but a goddess, in fact the Larentalia were celebrated in Rome on December 23rd, and Augustus then ordered that the party be performed twice a year.Akka in Sancrito means ""mother"". Therefore Acca Larenzia was the Mater Larum or "" Mother of the Lares "", and the Lares were the protector ancestors for the Romans, including Romulus and Remus of course.In fact, during the Laurentalia, sacrifices were offered to the Lares, cult of Etruscan origin, the spirits of the ancestors, who protected the gens, the extended family nucleus. More important than the family was in fact for the Roman the Gens from which he came, the one that could give prestige and fame, as well as protection. In fact it came even before the proper name: Julius Caesar belonged to the illustrious Gens Iulia (Giulia).In the land of the Sabines, a Goddess Larenta, or Larunda, the ""Dea Muta"" of the world of the dead, or rather of the ancestors, was worshiped."

64,UgzA6CsAF0lFQzx2Vnd4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy DEATH OF REMUS AND FOUNDATION OF ROMERomulus and Remus then left Alba Longa and went to the bank of the Tiber to found a new city in the place where they were born and raised.Livio reports two versions:Since they were twins and respect for the birthright could not function as an elective criterion, it was up to the gods who protected those places to indicate, through the auspices, who they had chosen to give the name to the new city and who should reign there after the foundation. Thus, to interpret the auspicious signs, Romulus chose the Palatine and Remus the Aventine. The first omen, six vultures, it is said was Remo's turn. Since twice as many had appeared to Romulus by the time the omen had been announced, the respective groups had proclaimed both king at the same time. Some argued that they had the right to power based on priority over time, the others based on the number of birds seen. A discussion arose and from the angry word fight it turned to blood: Remo, hit in the fray, fell to the ground.The version according to which Remus, in order to make fun of his brother, would have climbed over the newly erected walls and then Romulus, at the height of anger, would have killed him, adding these words of defiance, is more well known: ""So, from now on then, whoever dares to climb over my walls may die ». In this way Romulus seized power by himself and the newly founded city took the name of its founder.The version of Plutarch, in "" Life of Romulus "" is similar to that of Livy, with the variant that Romulus would not have seen any vulture. His victory would have been the result of deception, for which Remo was angry and the dispute arose that led to his death.When Remus realized that his brother had made fun of him, he was indignant and while Romulus was digging the moat with which he intended to surround the city walls, he scoffed at his work and tried to hinder him.Finally he crossed the moat, but fell hit in that same spot, according to some by Romulus himself, according to others by a companion of Romulus, Celere. In the fight also fell Faustulus and Plistinus, who is said to be Faustulus's brother and had helped to raise Romulus and Remus.According to others, Romulus had a wall built on the furrow (urvus, from which Urbs = city) traced with the plow, placing Celere as guard, to whom he gave the order to kill anyone who dared to climb over it. Unfortunately Remo had not learned of the order imposed by his brother and when he approached the wall, noticing how low it was, he jumped over it. The faithful Celere rushed at him and pierced him with the sword. Romulus, learned of the misfortune, was shocked by it, but did not dare to cry in front of his people, being by now a sovereign.In a widespread tradition, by the local peoples, the twins were granted a land that was equivalent to the perimeter of a heifer skin. The twins were not discouraged: they meticulously skinned a large animal and made it into very small strips, placing them one after the other. The furrow of the pomerium was traced on those borders of skin. Surely it alludes to a sacrificial rite of the heifer.It is very reminiscent of the myth of Cadmus who went to the Oracle of Delphi to find out where he should have founded the city of Thebes. The prophecy was: ""Choose from the bellowing cows the one that has a white full moon pattern on both sides. Take it as your guide on the road you will have to travel. Where the cow will kneel and first place its horned head on the ground, at that point you will have to sacrifice it to the earth plunged into darkness. After having sacrificed her, she founds on a hill, the highest, a city with wide streets . ""The allusion to the moon and the heifer suggest legacies of the Mother Goddess I, or Europa, the heifer. THE POMERIUMThe ancient cities, both Latin and Etruscan, required a magical religious ritual for the foundation. The center of the city, the ""mondus"", was established through the priests, tracing a furrow around it and sacrificing a heifer, a symbol of fertility, to delimit the sacred area.Then various religious symbols were buried in the ""mundus"", including the Lares and the Penates, as well as statuettes of the gods protectors of the city. The mundus became for the Romans Hades, or the kingdom of the dead.In this enclosure, called the pomerium or pomerius, only temples or sacred areas could be built, for which a second groove was traced, intended for the government of the people, that is the palace, the comitio, the forum etc.Outside of this one could build for citizenship, and then the fields followed. The walls were then arranged on the furrow. The sacred enclosure delimited and defined the Urbs, the city consecrated to the Gods and therefore unassailable and invincible. Only cities with a pomerium were Urbes. The others were Oppida, deprived of divine protection.The ancient Pelasgian cities are in fact built with three concentric walls of walls (see Artena, Norba etc.). The first with the great temple, the second with the palace and the agora, the third to protect houses and fields.In the legend, Remus is killed by Romulus, probably armed, because he crosses the sacred furrow, thus committing a profanation of the pomerium, a profanation that was paid for with death.Remus was buried on the Aventine in a place called Remoria, in memory of which a Remuria (or Lemuria) feast is celebrated every 9 May to remember the dead as Ovid tells us. Romulus was thus the first king of Rome."
65,Ugxg3uDULCY__bMtQQR4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy THE LEGENDAmulius ousted his brother Numitor to reign alone on Albalonga, killing his sons and forcing his daughter Rhea Silvia to become a vestal because he did not procreate heirs to his throne.The God Mars, however, saw the girl while she drew water in the sacred wood and raped her, making her pregnant with twins: Romulus and Remus.Amulius had her condemned and died because she had violated the vow of chastity, but the river Aniene, where the body was thrown, took pity on her and resurrected her. King Amulius, to save them, had the children placed in a basket, entrusting it to the current.Due to the rains the Tiber had overflowed (which it will do until the twentieth century with the new embankments built for a good eight meters high), flooding the fields of the Velabro, and on that bank, called Cermalus, the basket stopped. Then the waters receded and the twins found themselves at the foot of a fig tree (ficus ruminalis).For others the basket stopped in a cave at the base of the Palatine Hill, called ""Lupercale"" because it was sacred to Mars and Faun Luperco.A she-wolf, who came down from the mountains to the river to drink, attracted by the cries of the two children, joined them and nursed them. A woodpecker also brought them food, and the woodpecker was sacred to Mars. They were then found by a shepherd named Faustolo, the swineherd of Amulio, who together with his wife Acca Larenzia decided to raise them as children. The hut of Faustolo and Laurenzia was on the Palatine, in the ""Germalo"" area.Plutarch tells (Life of Romulus):It is said that the twins were brought to Gabii to learn the use of writing and everything that children of noble origins usually have to learn .. they were called Romulus and Remus in reference to the breast ... of the she-wolf ... Romulus seemed to possess greater capacity of judgment and an innate political perspicacity, showing in the relations with the neighbors for the right to graze and hunting a natural predisposition to command rather than to submission.And Livio adds (Ab Urbe condita):Strengthened in body and spirit, they not only faced the beasts, but ambushed bandits laden with booty. They shared the spoils of the robberies with the shepherds and shared serious and playful things with them, while the number of young people grew day by day. The twins were then attacked by bandits who wanted to take revenge on the loot they had stolen from them earlier. Romulus was saved, but Remus was captured and led by King Amulius, accused of theft in the lands of the king's brother, so he was brought to Numitor for him to judge. After several questions Numitor recognized his nephew while Romulus arrived and told him the family story. So the two brothers together with some companions killed Amulius and returned the throne of Albalonga to Numitore."
66,UgyuE9V4Dv65DTKoLg54AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy THE URBE« I don't know if it is really worthwhile to tell the whole of Roman history from the very beginning. Even if I knew it, I would not dare to say it, because I realize that it is an operation as ancient as it is practiced, while modern historians either believe that they can make some more documented contribution in the narration of the facts, or that they can overcome the crudeness of the facts. antique in the field of style. Whatever happens, it will still be worthy of gratitude that I have taken steps, within the limits of my ability, to perpetuate the memory of the deeds accomplished by the greatest people on earth. ""(Tito Livio, Ab Urbe condita, Praefatio, 1-3.)It seems that the first urban agglomeration settled on the Tiberina Island, reachable by fording, and later by means of a bridge, expanding on the Palatine hill around the 10th century BC, the Esquiline and Quirinal hills were subsequently occupied. Along the banks of the Tiber, up to Ostia, between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, there were many villages, each based on a hill, down to the sea.Before the ""foundation of Rome"", there was therefore a village on the Palatine, or on two heights: the Germalus and the Palatium, separated by a depression called ""intermontium"", and on the Velia, continuation of the Esquiline, between the Palatine and Opium.The other settlements on the surrounding hills will refer to this village:- the Esquiline, with the Cispius to the north, Oppius to the south and Fagutalis to the west;- the Celio, formerly Querquetulanus for the sacred oak grove, then Caelius by the Etruscan hero Celio Vibenna;- the Suburra da suburbio, sub urbe, on the slopes of Quirinale;- the Viminale towards the Esquiline.Over time these settlements are organized into a league, with federal bonds, the Saeptimontium (the seven mountains), or the league ""of the Seven Hills"". In reality there are only two hills, the rest are mountains. THE SEVEN HILLS    Aventine - Mons Aventinus;    Palatine - Mons Palatinus;    Quirinale - Collis Quirinalis, with the secondary hills of Colles Latiaris, Mucialis and Salutaris;    Viminal - Collis Viminalis;    Celio - Mons Caelius, with the eastern extension of the Celiolo or Caeliolus;    Esquilino - Mons Esquilinus;    Campidoglio - Mons Capitolinus, with the peaks Arx to the north and Capitolium to the south, separated by the ""saddle"" of the Asylum.They report that King Numa Pompilius celebrated, in May and December, a procession along all seven hills, with sacrifices on the 27 tombs of the Argei. Which shows that at the time Rome already collected the seven hills.According to Varro, the Argei were heroes following Hercules, who took away the Lazio lands from the Sicilian and Ligurian tribes and settled in a village, the Campidoglio, "" founded by the God Saturn "".The celebration was reserved first to the Latins, then to the Sabines of the Quirinale and then to the whole city. The myth of Hercules and his heroes suggests a patriarchal society that has replaced a matriarchal culture, as Bachofen demonstrated with his studies on Roman finds in the book ""The Matriarchy"". It is no coincidence that Hercules strangled snakes in his cradle that were the symbol of every Mother Goddess."
67,Ugzl-NQfHMtYS0IOTXJ4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy FIRST ROMAN SETTLEMENTSThe oldest settlements of what will later become Rome date back to very remote times, even to Neanderthal man. The oldest seems to be in the Valchetta area, with human remains from 65,000 years ago, another in via di Torre Spaccata from 60,000 years ago.We move on to the Iron Age with the arrival of the Latins of Indo-European descent, therefore not indigenous, first a Latin-Faliscan group and then an Umbrian-Sabello group. Those same Latins who met Aeneas, according to tradition, when, fleeing from Troy, he landed in Lazio. Rome was formed with the fusion of many different people, because where different civilizations converge there is an exchange that amplifies knowledge.No civilization can boast a mass of people and races like Rome, a point of connection between the West and the East, also because it stretches out both on the river and on the sea. In ancient times the ground was covered with forests and dangerous for wild beasts, coast-to-coast navigation, or by river, was the least dangerous way to move.The Falisci occupied the Tiber valley, between the Cimini mountains and the Sabatini mountains, while the Latins occupied the Latium vetus, the ancient Lazio, which ran from the right bank of the Tiber to the Alban Hills, bordering the Etruscans north of the Tiber. The Volsci, and in part the Ernici, instead occupied the south of Lazio; the Aurunci, and a little the Rutuli, the Lazio Campana coast; the Sabines the Apennine area to the north, the Equi to the east. It is probable that the Hellespontus in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) contributed to the union of cultures, when around 1100 BC, Troy fell and the survivors took refuge in Lazio.Excavations at the Foro Boario have uncovered some Greek pottery from the 8th century BC which already showed commercial relations with the Hellenic colonies at the time.The Palatine huts, of which there are numerous traces, had a shape between the rectangular and the elliptical, in all similar to those of the hut urns of the same period, found in the archaic burial ground of the Forum, which were used to contain the ashes of the deceased and they imitated the house where he had lived.The large holes along the edge and in the center were used to house the support poles of the roof, while smaller holes, on both sides of the doorway, had to support a particular and light cover in front of the door itself.The traces of the hearth were very clear next to the central hole.Their dating is from the 8th century BC, that is, fully corresponding to the date of the foundation of Rome, moreover, the remains of a palace have recently been found.The prehistoric tombs next to the foundations of the disappeared Arch of Augustus, in the Roman Forum, a culture similar to the proto-Villanovan one, with unadorned vases, probably from the 1st millennium BC, in the Bronze Age, testify to these settlements. A necropolis necessarily derives from a village of permanent dwellings.Another testimony is the necropolis next to the temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina with prehistoric burials, also in the Roman Forum, next to villages of huts, ranging from the 9th to the 8th century. BC, then reserved only for children's tombs until the 7th century BCThe ancient inhabitants of Rome inhumed, unlike the later Romans who mainly incinated the dead. Burial is characteristic of matriarchal or matriarchal societies, while cremation is patriarchal and nomadic. Which means that the ancestors of Rome were matriarchal, in fact returning the body to the earth presupposes a devotion to Mother Nature or Earth.Still finds from the Bronze Age in the area of ​​Sant'Omobono, at the church of Sant'Omobono, at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, with two temples, of the Dea Fortuna and of the Mater Matuta, from the sixth century. BC, two primordial Goddesses worshiped as Mothers of the pantheon, in short, Great Mothers of the Gods.The two twin temples were built on the area already occupied by protohistoric huts and only one has been excavated because the second is under the church. The Goddess Fortuna is the Greek Ananke, against whom, as Homer says, the Gods can do nothing, or the Roman Fatum, the one who guides the fortunes. It is no coincidence that in Palestrina there was the temple, Cicero talks about it, of Fortuna Primigenia, in whose temple lots were cast, that is, the dice to predict the future.In the center of Rome almost all the churches are built on pagan temples, to make people forget the old gods and because the people there used to go there. In addition, it was possible to take advantage of the marbles and columns. The famous Cosmatesque pavements so frequent in Roman churches are nothing more than Roman marbles that have been broken up and reassembled according to a design, and many of the columns are ancient Roman. To get an idea just visit the Pantheon where the gigantic Roman marbles are preserved intact.It seems that the temple of Fortuna dates back to Servius Tullius, and sacred prostitution, or Ierodulia, was practiced there, which was used throughout the Mediterranean and in all ancient civilizations, especially as a female priesthood (the male one is rarer). The sanctuaries were abandoned in the 4th century BC, with the end of the Etruscan monarchy."

To all that territories were imposed the latin language and then it evolve into several dialects, and when the countrys were formed they chose one dialect between  the various inside their land to be the national language like the portuguese, spanish, french, italian and romanian. so the other latin derived dialects were repressed to be spoken and they began to fade since then. It was the second time this happened the first time was when the latin was imposed and the former languages that were spoken like celtic ones began to fade; it is thought that they weren´t to diferent at that time to the latin since both decend from the same proto language.3) All true, when the latin derived languages were brought to america the roman empire there wasn't anymore but the newly cultures derive from it.4) Greece, Switzerland, Belgium, England, Germany  were not imposed to speak the latin language like greece because the greek language was a literature language for the romans that learned. the other ones i don't know much about it, i can guess that the romans doesn't imposed with too much strenght their culture and language to them."

301,UgxAOaTK9Id5vQcxbOl4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E,"Rome was founded 2500 BC, 15 generations after Aeanas of Troy which gives us a date. We also know Evander founded it and it later fell into Pelasgian kingship (Etruscan). It most likely became a city state 750 BC, when laws for Greek city states were established. Romans were of Greek descent continuing their Hellenic culture with their own flavour just as Aeolian Greek is the root to Latin which it morphed into. The Romans kept myth and the Greeks kept their history. Another reason why the Greeks did not find offence to Roman rule. Their lives did not change and their taxes were paid regardless of who it went to."

Sometimes it empowers stereotypes ect... because it is too simplistic that it muss the point as for a person that has no idea or knows no better might misunderstand. Your information in return sometimes not accurate enough cause how much oversimplifyed itis. You know things are not always simple. Yes you can try to simplify them. However,  like for example in calculus math you can't drive from a gradient. Definition of an equation beyond the slop means nothing. For someone that just started math it would mislead them. Just add more explanation points there and here where this is a possibility. Also for some topics it sounds you not very good at make more research. For example about the first Caliphate you didn't explain the political and militaristic nature it found itself in after prophet Mohammad death. You didn't know Persia hleped the rebellion against the Caliphate elected Government therefore it was targeted first and it was the main focus for a time. Also that there was alot of war declaration long ago during prophet Mohammad rule before becoming powerful and after actions of arrogance ect.. by the Romans and Persians. Especially the Persain ruler. This is just an example there is similar stuff happening with some other topic on your channel and other simplistic history  channels. Such as Crusades, WW2, cold war, Suni and Shia thing and other stuff i forgot. But there is alot of small point information that can be misinterpreted/misleading/misunderstood of important  ones and side ones that explain other things.

But I must say I really dislike that you don't clearly distinguish between myth and genuine historical theories in what you present. Romulus and Remus, birthed from Mars and suckled by a wolf, is obviously mythos, and you don't need much pre-existing knowledge to know that the Aeneid or descendants of Ulysses stories also are, but I feel like someone who wouldn't know about the Iliad/Odysseus could already be somewhat confused. And then it casts huge doubts about the rest, like how should I consider the Acadian theory for the founding, the Rape of the Sabines, the monarchy and its overthrow, and the whole story about Cincinnatus ? Surely these stories have all elements of truth, like we know that Rome had kings, had Patrician/plebeian conflicts, and must have been warring with other nearby tribes and cities, yet without knowing where they come from I have no way to discern what's been invented and when from what is legitimate scientific consensus or theory."

Bro Arabs just Adopted you after 10000 years of religion/civilisation when the snow melted and gave you their latest book(the bibel) and you think you are something. Hahah. You are literally the last human group to enter civilisation some hundreds years ago and if you werent nearby the Arabs you could've been living a life just like the Sebrians or the eskimos in Alaska.

Do you now understand the difference between south of Italy and north(the alps and its Germanic snow people). Too much ignorance in the west, dont you agree you need a new enlightenment by the Arabs since they lift no one else could produce a civilisation except when their bloodlines of Arabic Cananites came back to Andalusia and produced yet another civilisation? Can ethnic Germans, Vandals, Nordic, Anglo-Saxons produce a civilization?"

Feel free to ask more question fish hunter, no melanin person. Bro for Allah's sake you couldnt even produce a cuisine let alone a langauge or a civilization(civil from Arabic Sahel meaning coastlines).."
385,UgwYews8zs6qHOI2Txt4AaABAg.9M0hmCy-44y9aRoxkw2VUt,UgwYews8zs6qHOI2Txt4AaABAg,"@TheAn Onymous since I'm educating you, like we have always been since the snow melted and you left the eskimo life style, you are a product of Arabic civilization. You are worshipping the trinity belief system found by Arabs since right after Adam whereby Ishtar is the goddess, her son and the holy spirit blown into Adam(Roha in Arabic). The Syriac Arabs who fled western Arabia and settled in eastern med.then moved up to what is known today as Greece(from Arabic verb Grego meaning the refugee, the fugitive) they transferred their believes with them. To give you a heart attack, the cross sign which the Arabs made you believe in is nothing but a symbol of the goddess Ishtar who had been worshipped in all Arabic civilisations around the sunny/fertile med.shores for thousands of years. The letter ""t"" in Arabic represents the female ferility(Europa from Arab meaning fertile) and is a symbol of the goddess thus the eastern letter ""t"" that you believe is a cross has full ending signaling pregnancy of fertility whether the fertile earth that is pregnant with plant seeds or female pregnancy with living beings."
386,UgwYews8zs6qHOI2Txt4AaABAg.9M0hmCy-44y9aRnnYpsdDc,UgwYews8zs6qHOI2Txt4AaABAg,"@TheAn Onymous learn this also and sleep on it snow man. The alphabet that I write with right now is Arabic Cananite from western Arabia was given the name latin which is the feminine form of El(meaning goddess). Do you know who Elat(latin) is? I bet you dont. Elat is the name given to the goddess Ishtar the goddess of fertility(remember Arab meaning fertile and the Arabic queen""Europa"" means the fertile women). So basically, Elat(Latin) is the term giving to the Arabs who fled Athena(which is also an Arabic name) to establish Roma."

Talia is the nanny who took care of them not a wolf hahaha.

Some cities of the area was also strong military regional powers, like Taranto or Siracusa.It's obvious that Roman's had trade with them and by that, they started to share culture. You know, Greek civilization at the time was known as the finest thing ever. It was fashionable, it was wanted. Look at the Macedons like Philip the Second or Alexander the Great. They wasn't Greek but they wanted to be Greek to be recognized as ""civilized"" and ""powerful"". Same for Rome. At the time the Roman's was savages murderous bastards without glory nor good clothes or impressive monuments. Rome itself was a shithole made of dirt cabins and wooden stuff for the most wealthy.They wanted to improve their life, turn the city into something great and the first step to do it was to give her an identity, and a background.So Roman's started to give more attention to Greek culture, they also tracked down this story of Aenea to give to the founder fathers some nobility and the rest came from itself.You wonder why these myths about the foundation aren't all the same or someone is accepted and someone else it's not? It's simple: because they are all false. Fake stuff made just to make Rome more appealing to foreigners that have to invest on her. First and only great trade deal on Rome was Salt. Yes, salt. At the time salt was incredible useful to keep food safe from decaying and it wasn't cheaper. Roman's used to sell a lot of salt to the wealthy rich Greeks in the south. Through that trade they developed initially their city. And the Greeks? They figured out that was a shame having trade with poor people so they agreed in saying that Rome origins were true to be recognized too as the first who have found a great city of heroes and great men.""One hand wash the other and together wash the face"" its an old motto from Italy. You can figure out what it means. Don't be ""americans""..."

465,UgyY6JcJ9faGtLsl0yt4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E,"I feel like you skipped the most realistic and likely theory on the founding of Rome - it being a small village founded by a group of Latins way before 753BC, gradually growing in population (with the name of “Rome” probably naturally developing through linguistic development of the local language) being influenced principally by Villanovan culture common on the Italic peninsula (as seen by wattle-and-daub huts) before becoming culturally influenced by the numerous Greek city-states in the south through various means.As far as I’m aware, this is usually the consensus of historians who study this field and is most in-line with reality and the evidence collectively compiled.Edit: another thing I forgot to mention - Rome was likely the creation of multiple villages through a process of synoecism. As these local communities grew, they likely converged on various matters (economic, cultural, political) that they became united making “Rome” grow to absorb all these small, local villages within the area. It wasn’t just the community on Palatinate Hill that “made” Rome - there were likely many villages around that all helped to develop Rome (villages which we have no name for). Those communities are definitely unsung heroes!"

The Cananites tribe who migrated from western Arabia where everything started from Adam til now took their stories with them. History had been re-written and mostly is full of lies.

Rima and Romel(without the arabic Syriac addition ""s"" which means the moon that is given to high ranking figures in the society) are both children of Arab Cananite who fled Athena to establish Roma(named after Rima/Rama/Roma which means Gazelle). Talia is the nanny who took care of them not a wolf hahaha. The reason why a white wolf is associated with the name Talia/Tali is because the word in Arabic has different meaning depending on the context so Talia is also the name of any white baby animal be it a wolf/sheep/goat"

577,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg.9Ly4PtVtqv39OGNPpVFdNH,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg,Romams descended from Greeks. In the end the roman empire became Greek. The first settlement was built by the Arcadean Evander in the 12th century BC. Roman history begins in 753 BC but Rome constituted the expansion of an already existing Greek village. It was initially a city state. In 27 BC it became an empire. In 212 all subjects became Roman citizens. In 284 Rome was no longer the capital city of the empire. In 330 Constantinople became the capital city of the empire (again Constantinople constituted the expansion of the Greek colony of Byzantium). In 1453 Constantinople fell but the empire survived in the peloponnese until 1460.

Sometimes it empowers stereotypes ect... because it is too simplistic that it muss the point as for a person that has no idea or knows no better might misunderstand. Your information in return sometimes not accurate enough cause how much oversimplifyed itis. You know things are not always simple. Yes you can try to simplify them. However,  like for example in calculus math you can't drive from a gradient. Definition of an equation beyond the slop means nothing. For someone that just started math it would mislead them. Just add more explanation points there and here where this is a possibility. Also for some topics it sounds you not very good at make more research. For example about the first Caliphate you didn't explain the political and militaristic nature it found itself in after prophet Mohammad death. You didn't know Persia hleped the rebellion against the Caliphate elected Government therefore it was targeted first and it was the main focus for a time. Also that there was alot of war declaration long ago during prophet Mohammad rule before becoming powerful and after actions of arrogance ect.. by the Romans and Persians. Especially the Persain ruler. This is just an example there is similar stuff happening with some other topic on your channel and other simplistic history  channels. Such as Crusades, WW2, cold war, Suni and Shia thing and other stuff i forgot. But there is alot of small point information that can be misinterpreted/misleading/misunderstood of important  ones and side ones that explain other things.

Maybe Jesus' story was based on Romulus' story. Maybe the Israelites under the Roman rule wanted to create a story similar to the Rome's origin story with little changes to mock them....like how the Kingdom of Rome began with their King Romulus, the Kingdom of God/Israelites would begin with their King of the Jews, the Messiah, Jesus Christ whose story is very similar to the Romulus' story"

It's a much more self-aware story imo."

To those of us who grew up in Romania, he was a just but fair ruler still beloved to this day. To his enemies, who invented stories to cause others to detest him, he was a cruel cannibal that impaled mothers and babies together.

Orthodox, Catholics and even Protestants have mostly been rivals that's why they didn't give a shit when byzantine fell to the Ottomans. It was never about religious motivation.

854,Ugwi9AiiaWX0A4lRDGJ4AaABAg,Va9ffZVuuQM,"To hear the symbolism, not the history and not the poem. The Priam Prince Paris was in his double the Legendary Trojan General Aeneas, the twins Remus and Romulus's daddy. Who met the fallen soldier in the underworld. There the soldier told Aeneas, ""promise all soldiers uniforms and burials and no matter where they're from or why they fight, they will unknowingly be fighting for your purpose, Aeneas."" That was over 6000 years ago. As a parable is war itself. Aeneas / Paris the destroyer of worlds, you know I don't like him."

856,Ugz5m_our8ai8RFIxyR4AaABAg,Va9ffZVuuQM,Professor Diane Purkiss comes across like an entitled upper class woman who is very condescending and is above whoever she is speaking to...  I will admit that what I just said is based on my past experience with people who have the same inflection and mannerisms in the way she speaks and projects herself. I am not trying to make her out to be like someone who left me with a bad impression because for all I know she's a little sweetheart but I felt I had to say what I said...

1316,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,LdUWr6TGj6A,"Muy instructivo. Solamente un pero, no entiendo cómo al comienzo del video se sugieren 2700 años para la historia de Roma, que en realidad son unos 1000 años, a partir del 510ac. O si se quiere ampliar antes de la república, 200 años más. Civilizaciones anteriores como la egipcia si tienen más de 3000 años de historia. Un saludo"
1317,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8MErPlpZgOm,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"@Xabi Pombo Hasta lo que se sabe en lo que hoy se conoce como Roma hay una población fija desde el 1100 a.C. si no recuerdo mal y es exactamente a lo que me refería, la historia de Roma empezó mucho antes que el imperio, república e incluso monarquía al igual que Egipto, la historia no se limita a los imperios, en el 340 a.C. Roma ya era una ciudad con casi mil años de historia, si no más, puede que en un futuro se encuentren evidencias más antiguas. Aún así si contamos los años de reinados, imperios o similares (sin contar las épocas en la que la organización social era tribal) puede que Roma supere a Egipto, no estoy seguro pero andan emparejados y en mi opinión los egipcios tienen algo más de mérito ya que innovaron antes que casi cualquier otra cultura, de hecho Roma no sería lo que fue sin las civilizaciones de las que aprendió."
1318,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8MEUvQLb3qe,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"En ningún caso he hablado de imperios, solo quería reflejar que los orígenes de Egipto se remontan al 3100 ac, sin contar el predinástico, y como bien dices hasta el 340 ac aprox nos dan unos 2800 años de historia antes de que Roma ni siquiera existiese. Desde entonces solo han pasado menos de 2400 años hasta nuestros días. No salen las cuentas, por eso quería matizar. De hecho tanto la cultura romana como la griega y muchas otras de la antigüedad beben directamente de la Egipcia. Un saludo"
1319,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8LJ5UojMu75,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"+Xabi Pompo Se han encontrado evidencias arquitectónicas en Roma datadas en el año 1100 a.c. es decir que la fundación mitológica tiene muy poco o nada que ver con la realidad. Cuando se habla de la historia de Roma solo hace referencia a eso, su historia (en la cual se incluyen todo, idioma, tecnología, religión, medicina etc etc) otra cosa es el tiempo cronológico de la monarquía, república o imperio, pero la historia abarca mucho más, de hecho nosotros somos descendientes de los romanos, las leyes, cultura, costumbres... podría decirse que la historia romana continúa, casi todo nos lo legaron los romanos, por eso supongo que se diga que la historia de Roma tiene 2700 años, si no más. En cuanto a Egipto si se habla del imperio estrictamente egipcio, realmente el imperio egipcio dominado por egipcios es hasta el año 340 a.c. de ahí en adelante no se puede considerar imperio egipcio ya que pasó a ser parte del imperio persa, hasta la llegada de Alejandro III de Macedonia y pasó a ser parte del imperio macedonio hasta la caída de estos y ser reemplazados por los romanos, en resumidas cuentas el imperio egipcio no es tan longevo como la gente cree, la historia egipcia al igual que la romana si es más amplia, pero no ha legado tanto como los romanos, sobre todo en temas legislativos, logísticos, militares, tecnológicos, arquitectónicos... al menos para la cultura occidental, eso si, Egipto fue una gran civilización de la cual sus sucesores aprendieron mucho."

But i really loved the movie. Those two hours flew by ...

1368,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg.9Fntac2Fklf9ZWQY8d-G0f,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg,"@Crue Shaw Obviously, archaic Latin was closer to Proto Indo-European (a hypothetical Indo-European language spoken in the Euro-Asian steppes around 5000 BC ...). According to ethnologists these populations (who were very aggressive) moved towards western Europe subduing the various local populations and imposing their own language on them. After a few millennia there was no longer the memory of these invasions and Europe was divided into several distinct groups who were unaware of having a common linguistic origin."
1369,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg.9Fntac2Fklf9KaLvK295BD,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg,The latins were actually a neighbor of the newly founded kingdom under Romulus. It would take alot of wars and time to pass before the latin people and their language were fully assimilated into rome. What they speak I believe is a kind of form of proto-latain but its much more crude almost seeming to have hints of multiple ancient very ancient languages with everything from German to slavic.

We could even say that Romanian words are more similar to their original source than the italian ones. For instance I can't grasp much in what the actors are saying here. By the way the authors made a series from the same concept, Romulus, it's out now, great show"

Many people don't know that there were an ancient people who were also called latins. There are many languanges originated from the latin: spanish, french, portuguese, romenian, italian and galician. Sometimes the term latin is used to refer to people in some european country who speak any of this languanges, but not very often, I guess.These languanges and the apphabet that they created are a kind of legacy left by them to today's people.Even languanges like english received some influence by the ancient latin and greek.This movie seems to be surely fantastic."

For example, the eastern Mediterranean countries (Egypt, Syria, Greece, etc.) were already deeply civilized when the Romans conquered them. However, Romans brought civilization to the West. This is true. I have nothing against  Celts or against Germanics, but in the first century the populations of Gaul, Spain, Britain and Germany were extremely poor and backward compared to Italy ... this does not mean that they did not have a culture, they knew to make poor clothes, tools or jewels etc. however in the first century AD these peoples still lived like Latins lived 800 years earlier! (as it is described by this film ...), or rather like in the Neolithic period ... without advanced technical and engineering knowledge, without a state organization, without written laws, without even practicing writing! etc. etc. Do you understand? ...

They were dozens of tribes spread out cross europe, from northern Italy to northern Britain, speaking similar languages (like romance languages speakers today). They had a similar culture but again they were  divided in small populations . For instance one of the tribe that conquered Greece were probably Celts... The same Gauls that went to Anatolia ...Celts were certainly (not every Tribe) a society... I mean, they were much more sophisticated than history thought... Problem is: we don't know how far they went... They were fought by germans that were their neighbours and later by Romans..."

Even the Greeks and Romans did not believed that (see how Alexander took great length to guarantee the Celtic Confederation would not threaten his back before leaving for Asia, hence the alliance which would bring 80 000 celtic warriors in Greece during the Diadochi Wars). The fact that Romans practiced systematic destruction / ""damnatio memoriae"" helped forget what was there (France, Spain, Germany, etc.) before. Art, literature, science weren't greek or roman privileges (see the many, many amazing european pieces of art that are neither roman nor greek and often precede them by centuries), as modern archeology has proven. Considering engineering for example, ""polyeurcétique"" (sorry i don't know the english word, meaning ""art of doing a siege"") was known by greeks and romans themselves to be a celtic special skill (with the gallic wall, war machines, processes etc.), paved roads (you know the so-called roman ones) are celtic too (Hallstatt to La Tène era), mining idem, etc. For politics, the parliament system of the Celts may have preceded the greek one, scholars still debating on this due to lack of written evidences. It sometimes coexisted with monarchy, with elected kings and elected assemblies, long before modern monarchies."

There were the Celts , the etruscans, the umbrians , the venetians (and many historicians say that the central/ northern italians were part of the same European family , latins included ) but Greeks and then romans gave the modern term of civilization.

They were people not the bronze age that inhabited Europe from northern Italy to northern Scotland .....so... Which Celts are you referring to? Oh, Rome since the beginnings gave humanity just a little, insignificant thing: Right. Laws, moral behaviour (mos maiorum).

Though i don't agree with you on being ""immensely superior"", it's just that Romans were fascinated by the Greeks, reason why we still talk so much about the Greeks today, and that other people were bound to memorial damnation by roman laws (particularly the Celts who endangered Rome for centuries and were deeply hated for that), thus disappearing to the masses knowledge until recent times and archeological founds. And that alone has brought many problems to how our societies evolved, coming from an historical and sociological studies background that's my point of interest :-)"

And that's the prowess of the romans, they endured the struggle and succeeded in putting together peoples far more refined than them (Etruscans, Siculo-greeks, Celts, Iberians, ...) thus creating a great civilisation by mixing it all together. Should it be called Roman ? Nope, that was my point. In Europe we are bound by school to the myth of the romans bringing civilisation to the world, to the point it becames dangerous : all that preceded roman invasions is considered inexistant by non-history-oriented people, for example most europeans think their ancestors lived in huts, dressed in animal skin and beat their women before roman invasion. Forcing the trait here (we're on YT, not IRL debating for hours) but you get the point : on a sociological, religious (christian religion as we know it being a roman creation) and political level it's disastrous, and obvious when you compare roman conquered countries to others, and i think much can be learned for the time being and those to come by studying how roman influence brought the better and the worse to european peoples."

Of course, before Romans existed many advanced civilizations such Egyptians, Greeks, Asyro-Babilonians, Celts etc... each with it's own achievements in arts, technology, military power and so on.The Romans were the last in this big family and with them civilization reached the pinnacle of what we call the ""ancient world"". Romans absorbed everything that could be useful from the people they met, thus developing their own engineering, art, culture etc managing to create the first global society in history if mankind, that spanned across Europe, North Africa and Middle East.And the legacy of Greek-Roman world survives untill today.Nothing against other civilizations, but first the Greek and later the Roman civilization were immensely superiors."

The etruscans in the center north , the greeks in the center south and the other italian peoples who were deeply influenced by these civilizations were far ahead than the celts."

I've also read what other romans had to tell about the Gallic Wars (Pliny the Elder and others), and what Greeks had to say about the northerners.If i recall correctly it was Hecateus who talked of Pyrene, the famed ""big city"" of the Celts, and Nyrax, a merchant city. Still unfound, but one oppidum may be it : Heidengraben, 1800 hectares inside walls, 150 hectares for the ""acropolis"", and that at times when Rome was a microscopic city-state struggling with its neighbours. Rome would reach such a sheer size during octavian times, several centuries later. Only Carthago and Athens were approx the same size (2000 ha and 1600 ha IIRC) by celtic times.Wooden and rounded villages yes, and they wore animal skin and leather armor, and washed themselves once in a lifetime. Oh wait, that's Hollywood depiction of it, must surely be true ! As other Hollywood depictions XD Some of the greatest jewelry treasures of ancient times BCE ever found are celtic, amongst them the biggest bronze vase ever, and ladies stuff of a rare level of refinement (of course, ladies had rights to choose their husband, have a business etc. in celtic ""barbarian"" culture, while roman ladies were under the authority of their father of husband). Just look at that mirror backing, made when Rome was still a small royal city-state (400 BCE) :https://i.pinimg.com/originals/98/41/a7/9841a75875ad3674bda715fa59012f09.jpgOr that torc (100 BCE) :https://i.pinimg.com/474x/b9/73/bd/b973bdd0d9ad8a69fc6fd341ed4ed477--celtic-designs-motifs.jpgFor comparison, this is what Celts looked like 800 BCE before Rome was founded by the guys shown in the film's trailer :- standard soldier : https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/29/91/cc2991fe1a9e320ecc67787ac01a2b4d.jpg- noble one : https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/28/e9/0d28e9a9f80d7c583b26617e105fb79d.jpg- noble in civilian attire : https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/89/a4/7e89a46ccbd6e115a4db5e6d243b6dd3.jpg- noble lady in ceremonial attire : https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/27/b1/f627b17a57c4c233be1c8980453522af.jpgBtw those are historical reconstitutions (even in the making), not works of fiction. How primitive ?For the rest of the answer, have a look at my answer at another comment just above, where i talk about hot bath, armor etc."
1443,UgzX3tb-NryjroZKnR54AaABAg.924y-SKGz78939M6MczFfD,UgzX3tb-NryjroZKnR54AaABAg,"​@stig hansen ""the Romans dragged primitive Europe out of the Stone Age"" haha nice joke.For the record Stone age ended around 800 BCE in Europe, at that time the Greeks of the archaic period talked about splendors in the north, and Heidengraben was already a 300 hectares city with a princely / royal necropolis.Rome was not even a wish at that time, and farmers in Latium-to-be still used stone tools.When the Brennus army sacked Rome in 390 BCE, romans were still using bronze arms and armor, except for the very elite, while the ""barbarian"" celts fought with iron swords, protected by chainmail, their own invention used for centuries all over the world.That exact Rome, light of the world, that the ""barbarians"" sacked in 390 covered roughly 400ha, city, suburbs and fields altogether, while at the exact same time, at least 10 other cities in celtic Europe covered 350ha or more each, inside walls, and were only capitals, not city-states : Manching, Alcimoennis, Camulodunon, Heuneburg, and others i don't remember the names. Some of them had public hot baths, you know the ""roman invention"". And Heidengraben had reached 1800 hectares inside walls with a 150 hectares inner-city / acropolis. Carthage never exceeded that size, and Rome would reach it 2 centuries later, during the 1st century CE. The largest entrance in Heidengraben walls was 7m large and 35m long, to give some perspective.Around 100 BCE when some celts, divided by civil wars caused by demographics and lack of free lands (not really a sign of primitiveness when you begin to lack of fields for food), started a long migration, the so-praised roman army was wiped out in a couple years, not once, but twice, depriving Rome of 40-60% of the able males. And the celtic fighters were mostly armed civilians, women included. They inflicted the Roman legions the worst ever defeat in history, in terms of losses per hour : 120 000 KIA in 4 hours (Battle of Arausio, in today's France). The Romans lost a total close to 240 000 legionaries KIA in less than a year. Such a disaster it brought a guy, Marius, to power, to reform farming methods, military recruitment and training, and even citizenship conditions. And there would be much more to say about that precise period, but it would be long. You can search about the Tolosa Treasure, the romans captured it then lost it, and were strongly looking after it, even 2 centuries later : still unfound, it was 70 tons of gold and close to 400 tons of silver, by today standards it's approx 3,7 billions $. Not bad for primitives.50 years later, a descendant of the roman general defeated at Arausio swore to avenge him, restore his mother's name, and bring back the gold : Julius Caesar. He spread the light of civilisation by slaughtering hundreds of thousands of civilians during the ""Bello Gallico"", even other romans talked of a ""crime against the human kind"" (Pliny the Elder, Appien, ...). 1/10 of the Gauls were killed during the war, another 1/10 deported and / or enslaved. And the romans rapidly adopted the military equipment of the gauls, amongst other things : the chainmail, the segmented armor, the helmet, the shoes, the saddle, ...The cultural enlightment was such that during the so-called ""Pax Romana"", their was at least 1 rebellion every 17 years in celtic countries, and several ""independances"". They surely wanted another slice of civilisation."

This is why there is such similarities between Earth Mythology and Several Aliens in Star Trek. Including the name of the Klingon Home world Qo'noS, similar to the Ancient Greek ruler of the Underworld Cronus, before Hades. Additionally, Klingon Legend states that the Klingons Slew all their gods. Makes me wonder if that species who masqueraded as gods met their end by the Klingons on Qo'noS. All except Apollo of course."

I doubt they would have been susceptible to such things as ""gods"".

Aber dann schob sich in Blitzeseile der ""Raumflottenmarsch der Romulaner"" in den Vordergrund. Übrigens ist das ganze Stück eine IMPROVISATION - also gar nicht wirklich komponiert. Aber durch die heutige Technik ist's möglich, durch Aneinanderreihung von Audioschnitten der Motivik ein ganzes Stück in Windeseile zu ""produzieren"".  Ist auch bei der ""cadassianischen Hymne"" das erste Mal ""passiert"". Eigentlich hasse ich Märsche leidenschaftlich, aber sie zu komponieren macht irrsinnigen Spaß.

1784,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY271xaS5oMSM7,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,@Fedorahatter  in that case can u join the bad guys 
1785,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY270IkW4qD-8T,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,@Fedorahatter a race such as the romulus are awesome.  
1786,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY27-IawdpWTGE,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,"Many, many thanks to you, Lordzac!! I'm very happy you enjoyed!!!I appreciate it!Best regards,Volker H. :)"
1787,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC,ooS0Hop_zhk,Memoratum ! :D bellissima ^^
1788,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC.7-H0Z7-90i59AP95j8kTQe,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC,Ovviamente Romolo fondò Roma e Remo era il suo fratello gemello. Nel mito furono gli dei a decidere chi tra i due avrebbe fondato la città.
1789,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC.7-H0Z7-90i59AP8OEl6MMK,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC,La grande Roma si è spinta nelle stelle!
1790,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC.7-H0Z7-90i59ANr1oX1Scp,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC,"È bellissima è proprio latino.  Eh si i romulani sono i romani del 24esimo secolo. Ma se ci fosse un collegamento tra le due civiltà?  Le cellule degli antichi romani saranno volate nello spazio arrivando su Vulcano dove si saranno fuse con le cellule originali vulcaniane. In seguito alla guerra civile vulcaniana vinta dalla ""Raptor  Faction "", i vulcaniani vinti (  quelli con le cellule romane ) lasciarono Vulcano e raggiunsero i pianeti Romolus e Remus (tradotti in italiano Romolo e Remo ) e si rinominarono in Remani e Romulani. Ecco perché c'é il latino."
1791,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC.7-H0Z7-90i57-JNC-XSs3U,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC,"Grazie, grazie, caro amico, per il bel commento!!Migliori saluti,Volker H. :)"
1792,Ughs0m2uYoMh-XgCoAEC,ooS0Hop_zhk,***:-D!
1793,Ughs0m2uYoMh-XgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-An9T7-HDEh4GyGc,Ughs0m2uYoMh-XgCoAEC,@Volker400 Magnificatum;-)!
1794,Ughs0m2uYoMh-XgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-An9T7-H3DsM0Rn1,Ughs0m2uYoMh-XgCoAEC,"Gratiam, Jmedium Unum!! XDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
1795,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC,ooS0Hop_zhk,"It really sounds like ""See those ships coming towards you? Yep! That's our fleet of 2859 ships. And yes, you're screwed..."""
1796,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-ErLk9iWa5MFBgc1,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC,Lol yea
1797,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-ErLk9Jt9lfBaNjp,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC,"Best part of all, you wouldn't see them coming, they'd be cloaked until they're right on top of you."
1798,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-ErLk9FUJvfSm_nA,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC,"@Adam Hauson unless I'M the one designing Federation warships...I'd make sure I had 2 fleets....the Starfleet exploratory fleet would be crewed by civilians and have superior sensors for analyzing the cosmos but not much tactical ability to fight except for maybe against the occasional pirate...but beware enemies of the Federation, lest you think we leave our explorers unguarded, for the Federation Starfleet's mighty Mjolnir-class warcruisers are always lurking nearby (think a ship at least as big as a super star destroyer, with both the latest shields and Voyager's ""Engame"" armor, transphasic torpedoes, anti-proton cannons...which while nothing like the kind that the Doomsday weapon could put out should still be far more powerful than standard phasers....and finally for point defense some pulse phasers firing off at least Galaxy-class intensity phaser bolts...and metaphasic shield generators too.....for hiding in suns and catching an enemy unawares ;) :P - ship like that should be more than a match for even a Scimitar-class :P - oh and let's not forget the ability to launch a bunch of those Maquis-style fighter ships"
1799,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-ErLk94TYMtpI8LU,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC,"@Timothy Mckee I tried that with 54 Valadore MK.II warships and won while only losing about 1/3rd of that fleet, don't step on the super heavy romulan warhawk command ship's from birth of the Federation is all I'm saying."
1800,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-ErLk8WFafGlj9qe,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC,Why2859 ships?
1801,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-ErLk87dqDPG_kqD,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC,+Dávid Abonyi  They should've sent the fleet of 2859 ships to blow the crap of the Founders' Homeworld in 2371 then. Let's see the 150 Jem'hadar fighter ships take THAT fleet on!
1802,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-ErLk7-H3b18wxMX,Ugg8Y7HxQ_EDDXgCoAEC,"Ha ha, many, many thanks Dávid!!! I appreciate it so much! XDBest regards,Volker ;)))))"
