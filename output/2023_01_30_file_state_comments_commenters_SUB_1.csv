1401,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,m5V-IK1cEtE,Hannibal would have destroyed rome if he hadn't turned back becuase carthage needed him
1402,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8ghIABqilIY,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,Christopher is right he didnt have the ability there was no way he would ever be able to take Rome and he was Annihilated by Scipio
1403,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8b36_SUEzaI,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,"Ajmer Thethy hannibal lose Punic war because while he remained in capuae like a moron ,romans repelled carthaginian from Spain and defeated Syracusae , and even in Italy Hannibal lose battles , he was never able to defeat Marcellus , and lose an italian cities one by one , before his came back to africa barricaded at crotona."
1404,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8FkfAVZ1USw,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,"Well, if Hannibal hadn't pulled back to Carthage he would have done some really cool shit. He massacred the Rkmans largest army due to superior war tactics. Hannibal was too op for the Romans. The Romans and western civillization should be thankful that Hannibal pulled back."
1405,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8FkYJhQQFnV,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,Assaulting a fortified position is much more difficult than you may think. Also the Carthaginian troops weren't superior per se. It was mainly due to tactics and the fast moving Numidian cavalry that led to Hannibal's victories. Within the city streets the Romans could have simply formed defensive lines and tactics/the Numidian cavalry would be rendered inoperable.
1406,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8FkVBCFA_l4,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,"Are you kidding me? Hannibal was slaughtering the Romans all over Italy. If he hadn't stopped, he would have made his way towards Roma and probably burn it down, like the Romans did to Carthae."
1407,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8FIzeZG2XGj,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,"Hannibal did not have the manpower or siege artillery/equipment to adequately attack the city of Rome itself. Keep in mind the city of Rome itself was heavily garrisoned with a huge force of Hastati, Princepes and Triarii. To take the city itself would be suicidal. Had his brother managed to march from Hispania to Latium then maybe yes he would have had the manpower. However Publius Scipio (not yet Africanus) soundly defeated him not too far from Nova Carthago."

In short, the head of Purusha became the Brahmin, his arms the Kshatriya, his thighs the Vaishya, and his feet the Shudra, hence the four primary castes (or varnas) in Ancient Indian society (starting from the early Vedic age to India before 1947, though it became way more complicated by then). Though intimately linked to religion, the caste system was more of a socio-cultural construct than a religious one."

1698,Ugw2Y-WI7v_Buj6Vn-J4AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy LEGEND AND REALITYThe name Roma derives from the Etruscan name Ruma , an ancient goddess who had the ficus ruminalis as an attribute , sacred because the not yet ripe fig has a liquid similar to milk. The Pythagoreans also worshiped the fig fruit they carried in procession. In fact, a fig tree was perpetually at the foot of the Palatine. In short, the first Rome of the seven kings was above all Etruscan.The legend tells that Romulus and Remus were suckled under the fig tree, in reality the suckling fig comes from the Goddess Ruma to whom a small temple was dedicated next to the fig. Ruma or Rumina was the Etruscan-Roman goddess of infant feeding, to whom only libations of milk were dedicated.The name Ruma in fact means "" breast""and, like so many Etruscan names, turning into Latin they transform the"" u ""into"" o ""like the word"" rumax ""which becomes"" romanus ""in Latin. Thus Ruma becomes Rome.The legend tells that the two twins Romulus and Remus, abandoned in a basket on the Tiber river, they were suckled by a she-wolf who will in fact be the symbol of Rome. But the Goddess Lupa was also an ancient divinity, later assimilated to Acca Larentia, who was not a woman but the Goddess LupaIn its rites the priestesses practiced sacred prostitution, or ""hierodulia"" imitating the verse of the she-wolf. On the other hand, the goddess of Etruscan fertility ""Feronia"", venerated at the foot of Mount Soratte, in Lucus Feroniae, by Latini, Sabini and Falisci, was a she-wolf goddess.In ancient Rome, the derogatory term ""she-wolf"" remained to indicate a prostitute, the term ""brothel"" for brothels and the cry of the wolf that Roman prostitutes, no longer sacred, made to lure patrons.Acca Larentia was therefore not a woman, as the patriarchate tells, but a goddess, in fact the Larentalia were celebrated in Rome on December 23rd, and Augustus then ordered that the party be performed twice a year.Akka in Sancrito means ""mother"". Therefore Acca Larenzia was the Mater Larum or "" Mother of the Lares "", and the Lares were the protector ancestors for the Romans, including Romulus and Remus of course.In fact, during the Laurentalia, sacrifices were offered to the Lares, cult of Etruscan origin, the spirits of the ancestors, who protected the gens, the extended family nucleus. More important than the family was in fact for the Roman the Gens from which he came, the one that could give prestige and fame, as well as protection. In fact it came even before the proper name: Julius Caesar belonged to the illustrious Gens Iulia (Giulia).In the land of the Sabines, a Goddess Larenta, or Larunda, the ""Dea Muta"" of the world of the dead, or rather of the ancestors, was worshiped."
1699,UgzMyb8V3_WyeXQrl-t4AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy DEATH OF REMUS AND FOUNDATION OF ROMERomulus and Remus then left Alba Longa and went to the bank of the Tiber to found a new city in the place where they were born and raised.Livio reports two versions:Since they were twins and respect for the birthright could not function as an elective criterion, it was up to the gods who protected those places to indicate, through the auspices, who they had chosen to give the name to the new city and who should reign there after the foundation. Thus, to interpret the auspicious signs, Romulus chose the Palatine and Remus the Aventine. The first omen, six vultures, it is said was Remo's turn. Since twice as many had appeared to Romulus by the time the omen had been announced, the respective groups had proclaimed both king at the same time. Some argued that they had the right to power based on priority over time, the others based on the number of birds seen. A discussion arose and from the angry word fight it turned to blood: Remo, hit in the fray, fell to the ground.The version according to which Remus, in order to make fun of his brother, would have climbed over the newly erected walls and then Romulus, at the height of anger, would have killed him, adding these words of defiance, is more well known: ""So, from now on then, whoever dares to climb over my walls may die ». In this way Romulus seized power by himself and the newly founded city took the name of its founder.The version of Plutarch, in "" Life of Romulus "" is similar to that of Livy, with the variant that Romulus would not have seen any vulture. His victory would have been the result of deception, for which Remo was angry and the dispute arose that led to his death.When Remus realized that his brother had made fun of him, he was indignant and while Romulus was digging the moat with which he intended to surround the city walls, he scoffed at his work and tried to hinder him.Finally he crossed the moat, but fell hit in that same spot, according to some by Romulus himself, according to others by a companion of Romulus, Celere. In the fight also fell Faustulus and Plistinus, who is said to be Faustulus's brother and had helped to raise Romulus and Remus.According to others, Romulus had a wall built on the furrow (urvus, from which Urbs = city) traced with the plow, placing Celere as guard, to whom he gave the order to kill anyone who dared to climb over it. Unfortunately Remo had not learned of the order imposed by his brother and when he approached the wall, noticing how low it was, he jumped over it. The faithful Celere rushed at him and pierced him with the sword. Romulus, learned of the misfortune, was shocked by it, but did not dare to cry in front of his people, being by now a sovereign.In a widespread tradition, by the local peoples, the twins were granted a land that was equivalent to the perimeter of a heifer skin. The twins were not discouraged: they meticulously skinned a large animal and made it into very small strips, placing them one after the other. The furrow of the pomerium was traced on those borders of skin. Surely it alludes to a sacrificial rite of the heifer.It is very reminiscent of the myth of Cadmus who went to the Oracle of Delphi to find out where he should have founded the city of Thebes. The prophecy was: ""Choose from the bellowing cows the one that has a white full moon pattern on both sides. Take it as your guide on the road you will have to travel. Where the cow will kneel and first place its horned head on the ground, at that point you will have to sacrifice it to the earth plunged into darkness. After having sacrificed her, she founds on a hill, the highest, a city with wide streets . ""The allusion to the moon and the heifer suggest legacies of the Mother Goddess I, or Europa, the heifer. THE POMERIUMThe ancient cities, both Latin and Etruscan, required a magical religious ritual for the foundation. The center of the city, the ""mondus"", was established through the priests, tracing a furrow around it and sacrificing a heifer, a symbol of fertility, to delimit the sacred area.Then various religious symbols were buried in the ""mundus"", including the Lares and the Penates, as well as statuettes of the gods protectors of the city. The mundus became for the Romans Hades, or the kingdom of the dead.In this enclosure, called the pomerium or pomerius, only temples or sacred areas could be built, for which a second groove was traced, intended for the government of the people, that is the palace, the comitio, the forum etc.Outside of this one could build for citizenship, and then the fields followed. The walls were then arranged on the furrow. The sacred enclosure delimited and defined the Urbs, the city consecrated to the Gods and therefore unassailable and invincible. Only cities with a pomerium were Urbes. The others were Oppida, deprived of divine protection.The ancient Pelasgian cities are in fact built with three concentric walls of walls (see Artena, Norba etc.). The first with the great temple, the second with the palace and the agora, the third to protect houses and fields.In the legend, Remus is killed by Romulus, probably armed, because he crosses the sacred furrow, thus committing a profanation of the pomerium, a profanation that was paid for with death.Remus was buried on the Aventine in a place called Remoria, in memory of which a Remuria (or Lemuria) feast is celebrated every 9 May to remember the dead as Ovid tells us. Romulus was thus the first king of Rome."

King Amulius, to save them, had the children placed in a basket, entrusting it to the current.Due to the rains the Tiber had overflowed (which it will do until the twentieth century with the new embankments built for a good eight meters high), flooding the fields of the Velabro, and on that bank, called Cermalus, the basket stopped. Then the waters receded and the twins found themselves at the foot of a fig tree (ficus ruminalis).For others the basket stopped in a cave at the base of the Palatine Hill, called ""Lupercale"" because it was sacred to Mars and Faun Luperco.A she-wolf, who came down from the mountains to the river to drink, attracted by the cries of the two children, joined them and nursed them. A woodpecker also brought them food, and the woodpecker was sacred to Mars. They were then found by a shepherd named Faustolo, the swineherd of Amulio, who together with his wife Acca Larenzia decided to raise them as children. The hut of Faustolo and Laurenzia was on the Palatine, in the ""Germalo"" area.Plutarch tells (Life of Romulus):It is said that the twins were brought to Gabii to learn the use of writing and everything that children of noble origins usually have to learn .. they were called Romulus and Remus in reference to the breast ... of the she-wolf ... Romulus seemed to possess greater capacity of judgment and an innate political perspicacity, showing in the relations with the neighbors for the right to graze and hunting a natural predisposition to command rather than to submission.And Livio adds (Ab Urbe condita):Strengthened in body and spirit, they not only faced the beasts, but ambushed bandits laden with booty. They shared the spoils of the robberies with the shepherds and shared serious and playful things with them, while the number of young people grew day by day. The twins were then attacked by bandits who wanted to take revenge on the loot they had stolen from them earlier. Romulus was saved, but Remus was captured and led by King Amulius, accused of theft in the lands of the king's brother, so he was brought to Numitor for him to judge. After several questions Numitor recognized his nephew while Romulus arrived and told him the family story. So the two brothers together with some companions killed Amulius and returned the throne of Albalonga to Numitore."
1701,Ugy1eTYOznd_HfbY6R94AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy THE URBE« I don't know if it is really worthwhile to tell the whole of Roman history from the very beginning. Even if I knew it, I would not dare to say it, because I realize that it is an operation as ancient as it is practiced, while modern historians either believe that they can make some more documented contribution in the narration of the facts, or that they can overcome the crudeness of the facts. antique in the field of style. Whatever happens, it will still be worthy of gratitude that I have taken steps, within the limits of my ability, to perpetuate the memory of the deeds accomplished by the greatest people on earth. ""(Tito Livio, Ab Urbe condita, Praefatio, 1-3.)It seems that the first urban agglomeration settled on the Tiberina Island, reachable by fording, and later by means of a bridge, expanding on the Palatine hill around the 10th century BC, the Esquiline and Quirinal hills were subsequently occupied. Along the banks of the Tiber, up to Ostia, between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, there were many villages, each based on a hill, down to the sea.Before the ""foundation of Rome"", there was therefore a village on the Palatine, or on two heights: the Germalus and the Palatium, separated by a depression called ""intermontium"", and on the Velia, continuation of the Esquiline, between the Palatine and Opium.The other settlements on the surrounding hills will refer to this village:- the Esquiline, with the Cispius to the north, Oppius to the south and Fagutalis to the west;- the Celio, formerly Querquetulanus for the sacred oak grove, then Caelius by the Etruscan hero Celio Vibenna;- the Suburra da suburbio, sub urbe, on the slopes of Quirinale;- the Viminale towards the Esquiline.Over time these settlements are organized into a league, with federal bonds, the Saeptimontium (the seven mountains), or the league ""of the Seven Hills"". In reality there are only two hills, the rest are mountains. THE SEVEN HILLS    Aventine - Mons Aventinus;    Palatine - Mons Palatinus;    Quirinale - Collis Quirinalis, with the secondary hills of Colles Latiaris, Mucialis and Salutaris;    Viminal - Collis Viminalis;    Celio - Mons Caelius, with the eastern extension of the Celiolo or Caeliolus;    Esquilino - Mons Esquilinus;    Campidoglio - Mons Capitolinus, with the peaks Arx to the north and Capitolium to the south, separated by the ""saddle"" of the Asylum.They report that King Numa Pompilius celebrated, in May and December, a procession along all seven hills, with sacrifices on the 27 tombs of the Argei. Which shows that at the time Rome already collected the seven hills.According to Varro, the Argei were heroes following Hercules, who took away the Lazio lands from the Sicilian and Ligurian tribes and settled in a village, the Campidoglio, "" founded by the God Saturn "".The celebration was reserved first to the Latins, then to the Sabines of the Quirinale and then to the whole city. The myth of Hercules and his heroes suggests a patriarchal society that has replaced a matriarchal culture, as Bachofen demonstrated with his studies on Roman finds in the book ""The Matriarchy"". It is no coincidence that Hercules strangled snakes in his cradle that were the symbol of every Mother Goddess."
1702,Ugy3Abe4--so0UBe8Il4AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy FIRST ROMAN SETTLEMENTSThe oldest settlements of what will later become Rome date back to very remote times, even to Neanderthal man. The oldest seems to be in the Valchetta area, with human remains from 65,000 years ago, another in via di Torre Spaccata from 60,000 years ago.We move on to the Iron Age with the arrival of the Latins of Indo-European descent, therefore not indigenous, first a Latin-Faliscan group and then an Umbrian-Sabello group. Those same Latins who met Aeneas, according to tradition, when, fleeing from Troy, he landed in Lazio. Rome was formed with the fusion of many different people, because where different civilizations converge there is an exchange that amplifies knowledge.No civilization can boast a mass of people and races like Rome, a point of connection between the West and the East, also because it stretches out both on the river and on the sea. In ancient times the ground was covered with forests and dangerous for wild beasts, coast-to-coast navigation, or by river, was the least dangerous way to move.The Falisci occupied the Tiber valley, between the Cimini mountains and the Sabatini mountains, while the Latins occupied the Latium vetus, the ancient Lazio, which ran from the right bank of the Tiber to the Alban Hills, bordering the Etruscans north of the Tiber. The Volsci, and in part the Ernici, instead occupied the south of Lazio; the Aurunci, and a little the Rutuli, the Lazio Campana coast; the Sabines the Apennine area to the north, the Equi to the east. It is probable that the Hellespontus in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) contributed to the union of cultures, when around 1100 BC, Troy fell and the survivors took refuge in Lazio.Excavations at the Foro Boario have uncovered some Greek pottery from the 8th century BC which already showed commercial relations with the Hellenic colonies at the time.The Palatine huts, of which there are numerous traces, had a shape between the rectangular and the elliptical, in all similar to those of the hut urns of the same period, found in the archaic burial ground of the Forum, which were used to contain the ashes of the deceased and they imitated the house where he had lived.The large holes along the edge and in the center were used to house the support poles of the roof, while smaller holes, on both sides of the doorway, had to support a particular and light cover in front of the door itself.The traces of the hearth were very clear next to the central hole.Their dating is from the 8th century BC, that is, fully corresponding to the date of the foundation of Rome, moreover, the remains of a palace have recently been found.The prehistoric tombs next to the foundations of the disappeared Arch of Augustus, in the Roman Forum, a culture similar to the proto-Villanovan one, with unadorned vases, probably from the 1st millennium BC, in the Bronze Age, testify to these settlements. A necropolis necessarily derives from a village of permanent dwellings.Another testimony is the necropolis next to the temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina with prehistoric burials, also in the Roman Forum, next to villages of huts, ranging from the 9th to the 8th century. BC, then reserved only for children's tombs until the 7th century BCThe ancient inhabitants of Rome inhumed, unlike the later Romans who mainly incinated the dead. Burial is characteristic of matriarchal or matriarchal societies, while cremation is patriarchal and nomadic. Which means that the ancestors of Rome were matriarchal, in fact returning the body to the earth presupposes a devotion to Mother Nature or Earth.Still finds from the Bronze Age in the area of ​​Sant'Omobono, at the church of Sant'Omobono, at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, with two temples, of the Dea Fortuna and of the Mater Matuta, from the sixth century. BC, two primordial Goddesses worshiped as Mothers of the pantheon, in short, Great Mothers of the Gods.The two twin temples were built on the area already occupied by protohistoric huts and only one has been excavated because the second is under the church. The Goddess Fortuna is the Greek Ananke, against whom, as Homer says, the Gods can do nothing, or the Roman Fatum, the one who guides the fortunes. It is no coincidence that in Palestrina there was the temple, Cicero talks about it, of Fortuna Primigenia, in whose temple lots were cast, that is, the dice to predict the future.In the center of Rome almost all the churches are built on pagan temples, to make people forget the old gods and because the people there used to go there. In addition, it was possible to take advantage of the marbles and columns. The famous Cosmatesque pavements so frequent in Roman churches are nothing more than Roman marbles that have been broken up and reassembled according to a design, and many of the columns are ancient Roman. To get an idea just visit the Pantheon where the gigantic Roman marbles are preserved intact.It seems that the temple of Fortuna dates back to Servius Tullius, and sacred prostitution, or Ierodulia, was practiced there, which was used throughout the Mediterranean and in all ancient civilizations, especially as a female priesthood (the male one is rarer). The sanctuaries were abandoned in the 4th century BC, with the end of the Etruscan monarchy."

It’s very hard to believe that they were only 7 Kings in 244 years and the founder of Rome was raised by Wolfs. But to every folklore and oral tales they’re is the truth . I believe that Rome was founded by a group of people but it’s easy to just make into one person .Think about it this way. Imagine 300 years from now . Americans in 2300’s think George Washington was the founder of the USA

Romulus' birth by a virgin woman, going to heaven without dying and reappearing to a person to command him to spread Rome and conquer the world echoes Jesus' story. Maybe Jesus' story was based on Romulus' story. Maybe the Israelites under the Roman rule wanted to create a story similar to the Rome's origin story with little changes to mock them....like how the Kingdom of Rome began with their King Romulus, the Kingdom of God/Israelites would begin with their King of the Jews, the Messiah, Jesus Christ whose story is very similar to the Romulus' story"

Why couldn't one Rule Roma and one Alba Longa? Or one just find another city close by."
1911,UgwNrghKB2k0jmzg6xt4AaABAg.8nz94Tv-qQT8qzqjR_U_Eq,UgwNrghKB2k0jmzg6xt4AaABAg,"The name of the farmer was Faustulus and his wife's name was Acca Larentia, but neither of them mean wolf or she-wolf. However the romans usually used the nickname ""lupa"" ( = she-wolf) for the prostitutes (and the brothels were called ""lupanar"", like the famous one at Pompeii); hence the supposition that the she-wolf of the myth was actually Acca Larentia and that she was a prostitute."
1912,UgzoZCYEMcdjVgwiQw14AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk,Incredible but 7:45 that image shows the Romans wearing Lorica Segmentarta (body armour) which dates from roughly 2BCE to the 2nd century AD whilst Rome was supposedly founded on the 21st of April 753BCE so that particular image is wrong but apart from that AMAZING content and I really learnt a lot.

2078,UgzJGAgld94HCXFPuCl4AaABAg,l-P8t33xHuM," emoji_Italy FIRST ROMAN SETTLEMENTSThe oldest settlements of what will later become Rome date back to very remote times, even to Neanderthal man. The oldest seems to be in the Valchetta area, with human remains from 65,000 years ago, another in via di Torre Spaccata from 60,000 years ago.We move on to the Iron Age with the arrival of the Latins of Indo-European descent, therefore not indigenous, first a Latin-Faliscan group and then an Umbrian-Sabello group. Those same Latins who met Aeneas, according to tradition, when, fleeing from Troy, he landed in Lazio. Rome was formed with the fusion of many different people, because where different civilizations converge there is an exchange that amplifies knowledge.No civilization can boast a mass of people and races like Rome, a point of connection between the West and the East, also because it stretches out both on the river and on the sea. In ancient times the ground was covered with forests and dangerous for wild beasts, coast-to-coast navigation, or by river, was the least dangerous way to move.The Falisci occupied the Tiber valley, between the Cimini mountains and the Sabatini mountains, while the Latins occupied the Latium vetus, the ancient Lazio, which ran from the right bank of the Tiber to the Alban Hills, bordering the Etruscans north of the Tiber. The Volsci, and in part the Ernici, instead occupied the south of Lazio; the Aurunci, and a little the Rutuli, the Lazio Campana coast; the Sabines the Apennine area to the north, the Equi to the east. It is probable that the Hellespontus in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) contributed to the union of cultures, when around 1100 BC, Troy fell and the survivors took refuge in Lazio.Excavations at the Foro Boario have uncovered some Greek pottery from the 8th century BC which already showed commercial relations with the Hellenic colonies at the time.The Palatine huts, of which there are numerous traces, had a shape between the rectangular and the elliptical, in all similar to those of the hut urns of the same period, found in the archaic burial ground of the Forum, which were used to contain the ashes of the deceased and they imitated the house where he had lived.The large holes along the edge and in the center were used to house the support poles of the roof, while smaller holes, on both sides of the doorway, had to support a particular and light cover in front of the door itself.The traces of the hearth were very clear next to the central hole.Their dating is from the 8th century BC, that is, fully corresponding to the date of the foundation of Rome, moreover, the remains of a palace have recently been found.The prehistoric tombs next to the foundations of the disappeared Arch of Augustus, in the Roman Forum, a culture similar to the proto-Villanovan one, with unadorned vases, probably from the 1st millennium BC, in the Bronze Age, testify to these settlements. A necropolis necessarily derives from a village of permanent dwellings.Another testimony is the necropolis next to the temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina with prehistoric burials, also in the Roman Forum, next to villages of huts, ranging from the 9th to the 8th century. BC, then reserved only for children's tombs until the 7th century BCThe ancient inhabitants of Rome inhumed, unlike the later Romans who mainly incinated the dead. Burial is characteristic of matriarchal or matriarchal societies, while cremation is patriarchal and nomadic. Which means that the ancestors of Rome were matriarchal, in fact returning the body to the earth presupposes a devotion to Mother Nature or Earth.Still finds from the Bronze Age in the area of ​​Sant'Omobono, at the church of Sant'Omobono, at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, with two temples, of the Dea Fortuna and of the Mater Matuta, from the sixth century. BC, two primordial Goddesses worshiped as Mothers of the pantheon, in short, Great Mothers of the Gods.The two twin temples were built on the area already occupied by protohistoric huts and only one has been excavated because the second is under the church. The Goddess Fortuna is the Greek Ananke, against whom, as Homer says, the Gods can do nothing, or the Roman Fatum, the one who guides the fortunes. It is no coincidence that in Palestrina there was the temple, Cicero talks about it, of Fortuna Primigenia, in whose temple lots were cast, that is, the dice to predict the future.In the center of Rome almost all the churches are built on pagan temples, to make people forget the old gods and because the people there used to go there. In addition, it was possible to take advantage of the marbles and columns. The famous Cosmatesque pavements so frequent in Roman churches are nothing more than Roman marbles that have been broken up and reassembled according to a design, and many of the columns are ancient Roman. To get an idea just visit the Pantheon where the gigantic Roman marbles are preserved intact.It seems that the temple of Fortuna dates back to Servius Tullius, and sacred prostitution, or Ierodulia, was practiced there, which was used throughout the Mediterranean and in all ancient civilizations, especially as a female priesthood (the male one is rarer). The sanctuaries were abandoned in the 4th century BC, with the end of the Etruscan monarchy."

Both Romulus and Remus are the founder of rome but romulus is the first ruler of roma because remus was killed by his brother during dispute on how to interpret the sign from god. The twin brothers agreed to built a city in the seven hill of tiber river but one prefer on alvantine hill the other prefer on palpatine hill. They actually try to peacefully negotiate their differences by asking the god favour. However, both claimed the sign of god favour which lead to violence so remus did not have time to build different city and cross the wall of romulus city.  Remus was killed during the sign of god dispute. Another important thing that the video fail to mention that sabine women convince romulus and king of sabine to joint rule their combined city in peace. King of Sabine was much older than romulus, he died 5 years later leaving romulus as the sole ruler of the combined city  emoji_face_without_mouth "
