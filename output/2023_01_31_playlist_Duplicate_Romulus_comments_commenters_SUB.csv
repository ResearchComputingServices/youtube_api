19,Ugwf49B4Ms97oNorU594AaABAg,t6M5sFXKRcY,"Long ago in the kingdom of Alba longa lived a king named Numato, he was a magnificent ruler and had a beautiful daughter named Sylvia, Sylvia had a wicked brother Julius who overthrew Numato and took the throne for himself. Amilia speared that his niece would give birth to the sons who might try to retake the throne in the future, so he banished Sylvia to the temple of Mars to be a vestal virgin but Mars, the God of war fell in love with her and together they had twin sons, Remus and Romulus. Once the word got to Amelia's, he furiously ordered the servants to sneak into Mars's temple that night had killed the 2 babies but when the servants arrived at the temple, they couldn't bring themselves to harm the twins so instead they decided to send them away into the Tiber River so that Amelia's wouldn't know that they had lived. The river's currents were surprisingly calm. The babies did not drown infact the cradle drifted on to a bank just at the bottom of Palentine hill. The next morning a female wolf walked down the hill to get a drink at the river but when she did, she stumbled upon Remus and Romulus but instead of gobbling them up like any other wolf would do, she saved them and took them into her care like they were her own pups. When the boys grew up a shepherd names Posthumous found and took them from the Female Wolf and raised them. They grew up to be strong young men and would spread to the twin where the former king Numato had been banished to he realized that the boys were his grandsons and decided to have them come to him. When they arrived Numato explained to them everything that happened. He also informed them that they needed to overthrow Amelia's and take the throne from him. Romulus and Remus gathered an army of men, raided the kingdom and killed their wicked uncle. Once Numato was back on his throne, his grandsons decided that they wanted to start a city of their own but they were unable to decide where to build it so they decided to build their own separate cities but while they were building, Remus started to mock Romulus for having such low walls and leapt over them to prove his point. Romulus got angry and killed his brother in rage without hesitation and exclaimed, ""SO PERISH EVERYONE THAT SHALL HEREAFTER LEAP OVER MY WALL!"""

Unlike many other adaptations, in which Romulus and Remus are portrayed as two brave men who founded Rome for the survival of their people, in this novel both brothers are just immature brats whose actions are motivated by pure fun. At first, both youngsters spend the day dressed as wolves and playing pranks on the inhabitants of the village where they live. When their pranks end up causing King Amulius to imprison Remus and Romulus had to rescue him by killing the ruler, the two brothers realize how much fun it is to conquer other towns. With the help of their group of followers, who are also immature kids, Romulus and Remus decide to start attacking other villages and also decide to turn their own home into a city, just to ""know what might come of it"". Even after creating Rome and killing Remus, Romulus, already as king, continues with his immature attitude and decides to organize the Rapture of the Sabines, not to repopulate the city, but to troll the Sabines and have a good laugh at them. However, Romulus ends up paying for his impertinence when, after 40 years reigning, the senators get fed up with his carefree attitude and assassinate him. Literally, if this Romulus had seen what the city he created would end up becoming long after his death, he would have said: ""It was just a prank, bros...""  emoji_crying_face "

Because all your imperial idea is going to collapse. So you try to make fake Greeks civilization (they have no culture /civilization to make their own alphabets) . Etruscans had their own alphabets (this affets Romans and they borrowed it from them and create Latin language)  that there are 6 lettters as same as Göktürk alphabet (Orhun monuments, about 5-6 centuries) , and there are 2 of them only in Gökturk and Etruscans alphabet."

Greece tried to make everyone Hellenistic. Persia is the only empire that did not destroy other cultures or religions, it respected all. Therefore they are glorified in the Bible and Greece and Rome r not. When Persia defeated Babylon they allowed the defeated king to remain in power, they kept Babylonian customs. Babylon had to only pay taxes in return. They did the same with Egypt etc. Alexander did the opposite he tried to make Egypt Hellenistic. Similar to what Arabs did to many parts of Middle East, or what Anglo saxons did to native Americans, enforce their culture and annihilate what they encounter. Persia never did that. They respected others, ppl were free under Persian rule. This was not the case within Greek city states. So the idea of evil Persians trying to destroy Greece is laughable. Alexander did more destruction to Greece than the Persians. Look up destruction of Thebes. by modern standards Persia was far ahead everyone incl. ancient Greece in terms of religious freedom (the Jews loved Persia) human rights, women rights, labor rights etc. It would take the rest of the world 2500 years to catch up.But u continue to live in your fairy tale. western distortion of history will be exposed.

774,Ugy8Q-6m9cYd8ElnEYV4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy LEGEND AND REALITYThe name Roma derives from the Etruscan name Ruma , an ancient goddess who had the ficus ruminalis as an attribute , sacred because the not yet ripe fig has a liquid similar to milk. The Pythagoreans also worshiped the fig fruit they carried in procession. In fact, a fig tree was perpetually at the foot of the Palatine. In short, the first Rome of the seven kings was above all Etruscan.The legend tells that Romulus and Remus were suckled under the fig tree, in reality the suckling fig comes from the Goddess Ruma to whom a small temple was dedicated next to the fig. Ruma or Rumina was the Etruscan-Roman goddess of infant feeding, to whom only libations of milk were dedicated.The name Ruma in fact means "" breast""and, like so many Etruscan names, turning into Latin they transform the"" u ""into"" o ""like the word"" rumax ""which becomes"" romanus ""in Latin. Thus Ruma becomes Rome.The legend tells that the two twins Romulus and Remus, abandoned in a basket on the Tiber river, they were suckled by a she-wolf who will in fact be the symbol of Rome. But the Goddess Lupa was also an ancient divinity, later assimilated to Acca Larentia, who was not a woman but the Goddess LupaIn its rites the priestesses practiced sacred prostitution, or ""hierodulia"" imitating the verse of the she-wolf. On the other hand, the goddess of Etruscan fertility ""Feronia"", venerated at the foot of Mount Soratte, in Lucus Feroniae, by Latini, Sabini and Falisci, was a she-wolf goddess.In ancient Rome, the derogatory term ""she-wolf"" remained to indicate a prostitute, the term ""brothel"" for brothels and the cry of the wolf that Roman prostitutes, no longer sacred, made to lure patrons.Acca Larentia was therefore not a woman, as the patriarchate tells, but a goddess, in fact the Larentalia were celebrated in Rome on December 23rd, and Augustus then ordered that the party be performed twice a year.Akka in Sancrito means ""mother"". Therefore Acca Larenzia was the Mater Larum or "" Mother of the Lares "", and the Lares were the protector ancestors for the Romans, including Romulus and Remus of course.In fact, during the Laurentalia, sacrifices were offered to the Lares, cult of Etruscan origin, the spirits of the ancestors, who protected the gens, the extended family nucleus. More important than the family was in fact for the Roman the Gens from which he came, the one that could give prestige and fame, as well as protection. In fact it came even before the proper name: Julius Caesar belonged to the illustrious Gens Iulia (Giulia).In the land of the Sabines, a Goddess Larenta, or Larunda, the ""Dea Muta"" of the world of the dead, or rather of the ancestors, was worshiped."

776,UgzA6CsAF0lFQzx2Vnd4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy DEATH OF REMUS AND FOUNDATION OF ROMERomulus and Remus then left Alba Longa and went to the bank of the Tiber to found a new city in the place where they were born and raised.Livio reports two versions:Since they were twins and respect for the birthright could not function as an elective criterion, it was up to the gods who protected those places to indicate, through the auspices, who they had chosen to give the name to the new city and who should reign there after the foundation. Thus, to interpret the auspicious signs, Romulus chose the Palatine and Remus the Aventine. The first omen, six vultures, it is said was Remo's turn. Since twice as many had appeared to Romulus by the time the omen had been announced, the respective groups had proclaimed both king at the same time. Some argued that they had the right to power based on priority over time, the others based on the number of birds seen. A discussion arose and from the angry word fight it turned to blood: Remo, hit in the fray, fell to the ground.The version according to which Remus, in order to make fun of his brother, would have climbed over the newly erected walls and then Romulus, at the height of anger, would have killed him, adding these words of defiance, is more well known: ""So, from now on then, whoever dares to climb over my walls may die ». In this way Romulus seized power by himself and the newly founded city took the name of its founder.The version of Plutarch, in "" Life of Romulus "" is similar to that of Livy, with the variant that Romulus would not have seen any vulture. His victory would have been the result of deception, for which Remo was angry and the dispute arose that led to his death.When Remus realized that his brother had made fun of him, he was indignant and while Romulus was digging the moat with which he intended to surround the city walls, he scoffed at his work and tried to hinder him.Finally he crossed the moat, but fell hit in that same spot, according to some by Romulus himself, according to others by a companion of Romulus, Celere. In the fight also fell Faustulus and Plistinus, who is said to be Faustulus's brother and had helped to raise Romulus and Remus.According to others, Romulus had a wall built on the furrow (urvus, from which Urbs = city) traced with the plow, placing Celere as guard, to whom he gave the order to kill anyone who dared to climb over it. Unfortunately Remo had not learned of the order imposed by his brother and when he approached the wall, noticing how low it was, he jumped over it. The faithful Celere rushed at him and pierced him with the sword. Romulus, learned of the misfortune, was shocked by it, but did not dare to cry in front of his people, being by now a sovereign.In a widespread tradition, by the local peoples, the twins were granted a land that was equivalent to the perimeter of a heifer skin. The twins were not discouraged: they meticulously skinned a large animal and made it into very small strips, placing them one after the other. The furrow of the pomerium was traced on those borders of skin. Surely it alludes to a sacrificial rite of the heifer.It is very reminiscent of the myth of Cadmus who went to the Oracle of Delphi to find out where he should have founded the city of Thebes. The prophecy was: ""Choose from the bellowing cows the one that has a white full moon pattern on both sides. Take it as your guide on the road you will have to travel. Where the cow will kneel and first place its horned head on the ground, at that point you will have to sacrifice it to the earth plunged into darkness. After having sacrificed her, she founds on a hill, the highest, a city with wide streets . ""The allusion to the moon and the heifer suggest legacies of the Mother Goddess I, or Europa, the heifer. THE POMERIUMThe ancient cities, both Latin and Etruscan, required a magical religious ritual for the foundation. The center of the city, the ""mondus"", was established through the priests, tracing a furrow around it and sacrificing a heifer, a symbol of fertility, to delimit the sacred area.Then various religious symbols were buried in the ""mundus"", including the Lares and the Penates, as well as statuettes of the gods protectors of the city. The mundus became for the Romans Hades, or the kingdom of the dead.In this enclosure, called the pomerium or pomerius, only temples or sacred areas could be built, for which a second groove was traced, intended for the government of the people, that is the palace, the comitio, the forum etc.Outside of this one could build for citizenship, and then the fields followed. The walls were then arranged on the furrow. The sacred enclosure delimited and defined the Urbs, the city consecrated to the Gods and therefore unassailable and invincible. Only cities with a pomerium were Urbes. The others were Oppida, deprived of divine protection.The ancient Pelasgian cities are in fact built with three concentric walls of walls (see Artena, Norba etc.). The first with the great temple, the second with the palace and the agora, the third to protect houses and fields.In the legend, Remus is killed by Romulus, probably armed, because he crosses the sacred furrow, thus committing a profanation of the pomerium, a profanation that was paid for with death.Remus was buried on the Aventine in a place called Remoria, in memory of which a Remuria (or Lemuria) feast is celebrated every 9 May to remember the dead as Ovid tells us. Romulus was thus the first king of Rome."
777,Ugxg3uDULCY__bMtQQR4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy THE LEGENDAmulius ousted his brother Numitor to reign alone on Albalonga, killing his sons and forcing his daughter Rhea Silvia to become a vestal because he did not procreate heirs to his throne.The God Mars, however, saw the girl while she drew water in the sacred wood and raped her, making her pregnant with twins: Romulus and Remus.Amulius had her condemned and died because she had violated the vow of chastity, but the river Aniene, where the body was thrown, took pity on her and resurrected her. King Amulius, to save them, had the children placed in a basket, entrusting it to the current.Due to the rains the Tiber had overflowed (which it will do until the twentieth century with the new embankments built for a good eight meters high), flooding the fields of the Velabro, and on that bank, called Cermalus, the basket stopped. Then the waters receded and the twins found themselves at the foot of a fig tree (ficus ruminalis).For others the basket stopped in a cave at the base of the Palatine Hill, called ""Lupercale"" because it was sacred to Mars and Faun Luperco.A she-wolf, who came down from the mountains to the river to drink, attracted by the cries of the two children, joined them and nursed them. A woodpecker also brought them food, and the woodpecker was sacred to Mars. They were then found by a shepherd named Faustolo, the swineherd of Amulio, who together with his wife Acca Larenzia decided to raise them as children. The hut of Faustolo and Laurenzia was on the Palatine, in the ""Germalo"" area.Plutarch tells (Life of Romulus):It is said that the twins were brought to Gabii to learn the use of writing and everything that children of noble origins usually have to learn .. they were called Romulus and Remus in reference to the breast ... of the she-wolf ... Romulus seemed to possess greater capacity of judgment and an innate political perspicacity, showing in the relations with the neighbors for the right to graze and hunting a natural predisposition to command rather than to submission.And Livio adds (Ab Urbe condita):Strengthened in body and spirit, they not only faced the beasts, but ambushed bandits laden with booty. They shared the spoils of the robberies with the shepherds and shared serious and playful things with them, while the number of young people grew day by day. The twins were then attacked by bandits who wanted to take revenge on the loot they had stolen from them earlier. Romulus was saved, but Remus was captured and led by King Amulius, accused of theft in the lands of the king's brother, so he was brought to Numitor for him to judge. After several questions Numitor recognized his nephew while Romulus arrived and told him the family story. So the two brothers together with some companions killed Amulius and returned the throne of Albalonga to Numitore."
778,UgyuE9V4Dv65DTKoLg54AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy THE URBE« I don't know if it is really worthwhile to tell the whole of Roman history from the very beginning. Even if I knew it, I would not dare to say it, because I realize that it is an operation as ancient as it is practiced, while modern historians either believe that they can make some more documented contribution in the narration of the facts, or that they can overcome the crudeness of the facts. antique in the field of style. Whatever happens, it will still be worthy of gratitude that I have taken steps, within the limits of my ability, to perpetuate the memory of the deeds accomplished by the greatest people on earth. ""(Tito Livio, Ab Urbe condita, Praefatio, 1-3.)It seems that the first urban agglomeration settled on the Tiberina Island, reachable by fording, and later by means of a bridge, expanding on the Palatine hill around the 10th century BC, the Esquiline and Quirinal hills were subsequently occupied. Along the banks of the Tiber, up to Ostia, between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, there were many villages, each based on a hill, down to the sea.Before the ""foundation of Rome"", there was therefore a village on the Palatine, or on two heights: the Germalus and the Palatium, separated by a depression called ""intermontium"", and on the Velia, continuation of the Esquiline, between the Palatine and Opium.The other settlements on the surrounding hills will refer to this village:- the Esquiline, with the Cispius to the north, Oppius to the south and Fagutalis to the west;- the Celio, formerly Querquetulanus for the sacred oak grove, then Caelius by the Etruscan hero Celio Vibenna;- the Suburra da suburbio, sub urbe, on the slopes of Quirinale;- the Viminale towards the Esquiline.Over time these settlements are organized into a league, with federal bonds, the Saeptimontium (the seven mountains), or the league ""of the Seven Hills"". In reality there are only two hills, the rest are mountains. THE SEVEN HILLS    Aventine - Mons Aventinus;    Palatine - Mons Palatinus;    Quirinale - Collis Quirinalis, with the secondary hills of Colles Latiaris, Mucialis and Salutaris;    Viminal - Collis Viminalis;    Celio - Mons Caelius, with the eastern extension of the Celiolo or Caeliolus;    Esquilino - Mons Esquilinus;    Campidoglio - Mons Capitolinus, with the peaks Arx to the north and Capitolium to the south, separated by the ""saddle"" of the Asylum.They report that King Numa Pompilius celebrated, in May and December, a procession along all seven hills, with sacrifices on the 27 tombs of the Argei. Which shows that at the time Rome already collected the seven hills.According to Varro, the Argei were heroes following Hercules, who took away the Lazio lands from the Sicilian and Ligurian tribes and settled in a village, the Campidoglio, "" founded by the God Saturn "".The celebration was reserved first to the Latins, then to the Sabines of the Quirinale and then to the whole city. The myth of Hercules and his heroes suggests a patriarchal society that has replaced a matriarchal culture, as Bachofen demonstrated with his studies on Roman finds in the book ""The Matriarchy"". It is no coincidence that Hercules strangled snakes in his cradle that were the symbol of every Mother Goddess."
779,Ugzl-NQfHMtYS0IOTXJ4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy FIRST ROMAN SETTLEMENTSThe oldest settlements of what will later become Rome date back to very remote times, even to Neanderthal man. The oldest seems to be in the Valchetta area, with human remains from 65,000 years ago, another in via di Torre Spaccata from 60,000 years ago.We move on to the Iron Age with the arrival of the Latins of Indo-European descent, therefore not indigenous, first a Latin-Faliscan group and then an Umbrian-Sabello group. Those same Latins who met Aeneas, according to tradition, when, fleeing from Troy, he landed in Lazio. Rome was formed with the fusion of many different people, because where different civilizations converge there is an exchange that amplifies knowledge.No civilization can boast a mass of people and races like Rome, a point of connection between the West and the East, also because it stretches out both on the river and on the sea. In ancient times the ground was covered with forests and dangerous for wild beasts, coast-to-coast navigation, or by river, was the least dangerous way to move.The Falisci occupied the Tiber valley, between the Cimini mountains and the Sabatini mountains, while the Latins occupied the Latium vetus, the ancient Lazio, which ran from the right bank of the Tiber to the Alban Hills, bordering the Etruscans north of the Tiber. The Volsci, and in part the Ernici, instead occupied the south of Lazio; the Aurunci, and a little the Rutuli, the Lazio Campana coast; the Sabines the Apennine area to the north, the Equi to the east. It is probable that the Hellespontus in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) contributed to the union of cultures, when around 1100 BC, Troy fell and the survivors took refuge in Lazio.Excavations at the Foro Boario have uncovered some Greek pottery from the 8th century BC which already showed commercial relations with the Hellenic colonies at the time.The Palatine huts, of which there are numerous traces, had a shape between the rectangular and the elliptical, in all similar to those of the hut urns of the same period, found in the archaic burial ground of the Forum, which were used to contain the ashes of the deceased and they imitated the house where he had lived.The large holes along the edge and in the center were used to house the support poles of the roof, while smaller holes, on both sides of the doorway, had to support a particular and light cover in front of the door itself.The traces of the hearth were very clear next to the central hole.Their dating is from the 8th century BC, that is, fully corresponding to the date of the foundation of Rome, moreover, the remains of a palace have recently been found.The prehistoric tombs next to the foundations of the disappeared Arch of Augustus, in the Roman Forum, a culture similar to the proto-Villanovan one, with unadorned vases, probably from the 1st millennium BC, in the Bronze Age, testify to these settlements. A necropolis necessarily derives from a village of permanent dwellings.Another testimony is the necropolis next to the temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina with prehistoric burials, also in the Roman Forum, next to villages of huts, ranging from the 9th to the 8th century. BC, then reserved only for children's tombs until the 7th century BCThe ancient inhabitants of Rome inhumed, unlike the later Romans who mainly incinated the dead. Burial is characteristic of matriarchal or matriarchal societies, while cremation is patriarchal and nomadic. Which means that the ancestors of Rome were matriarchal, in fact returning the body to the earth presupposes a devotion to Mother Nature or Earth.Still finds from the Bronze Age in the area of ​​Sant'Omobono, at the church of Sant'Omobono, at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, with two temples, of the Dea Fortuna and of the Mater Matuta, from the sixth century. BC, two primordial Goddesses worshiped as Mothers of the pantheon, in short, Great Mothers of the Gods.The two twin temples were built on the area already occupied by protohistoric huts and only one has been excavated because the second is under the church. The Goddess Fortuna is the Greek Ananke, against whom, as Homer says, the Gods can do nothing, or the Roman Fatum, the one who guides the fortunes. It is no coincidence that in Palestrina there was the temple, Cicero talks about it, of Fortuna Primigenia, in whose temple lots were cast, that is, the dice to predict the future.In the center of Rome almost all the churches are built on pagan temples, to make people forget the old gods and because the people there used to go there. In addition, it was possible to take advantage of the marbles and columns. The famous Cosmatesque pavements so frequent in Roman churches are nothing more than Roman marbles that have been broken up and reassembled according to a design, and many of the columns are ancient Roman. To get an idea just visit the Pantheon where the gigantic Roman marbles are preserved intact.It seems that the temple of Fortuna dates back to Servius Tullius, and sacred prostitution, or Ierodulia, was practiced there, which was used throughout the Mediterranean and in all ancient civilizations, especially as a female priesthood (the male one is rarer). The sanctuaries were abandoned in the 4th century BC, with the end of the Etruscan monarchy."

To all that territories were imposed the latin language and then it evolve into several dialects, and when the countrys were formed they chose one dialect between  the various inside their land to be the national language like the portuguese, spanish, french, italian and romanian. so the other latin derived dialects were repressed to be spoken and they began to fade since then. It was the second time this happened the first time was when the latin was imposed and the former languages that were spoken like celtic ones began to fade; it is thought that they weren´t to diferent at that time to the latin since both decend from the same proto language.3) All true, when the latin derived languages were brought to america the roman empire there wasn't anymore but the newly cultures derive from it.4) Greece, Switzerland, Belgium, England, Germany  were not imposed to speak the latin language like greece because the greek language was a literature language for the romans that learned. the other ones i don't know much about it, i can guess that the romans doesn't imposed with too much strenght their culture and language to them."

We also know Evander founded it and it later fell into Pelasgian kingship (Etruscan). It most likely became a city state 750 BC, when laws for Greek city states were established. Romans were of Greek descent continuing their Hellenic culture with their own flavour just as Aeolian Greek is the root to Latin which it morphed into. The Romans kept myth and the Greeks kept their history. Another reason why the Greeks did not find offence to Roman rule. Their lives did not change and their taxes were paid regardless of who it went to."

Sometimes it empowers stereotypes ect... because it is too simplistic that it muss the point as for a person that has no idea or knows no better might misunderstand. Your information in return sometimes not accurate enough cause how much oversimplifyed itis. You know things are not always simple. Yes you can try to simplify them. However,  like for example in calculus math you can't drive from a gradient. Definition of an equation beyond the slop means nothing. For someone that just started math it would mislead them. Just add more explanation points there and here where this is a possibility. Also for some topics it sounds you not very good at make more research. For example about the first Caliphate you didn't explain the political and militaristic nature it found itself in after prophet Mohammad death. You didn't know Persia hleped the rebellion against the Caliphate elected Government therefore it was targeted first and it was the main focus for a time. Also that there was alot of war declaration long ago during prophet Mohammad rule before becoming powerful and after actions of arrogance ect.. by the Romans and Persians. Especially the Persain ruler. This is just an example there is similar stuff happening with some other topic on your channel and other simplistic history  channels. Such as Crusades, WW2, cold war, Suni and Shia thing and other stuff i forgot. But there is alot of small point information that can be misinterpreted/misleading/misunderstood of important  ones and side ones that explain other things.

But I must say I really dislike that you don't clearly distinguish between myth and genuine historical theories in what you present. Romulus and Remus, birthed from Mars and suckled by a wolf, is obviously mythos, and you don't need much pre-existing knowledge to know that the Aeneid or descendants of Ulysses stories also are, but I feel like someone who wouldn't know about the Iliad/Odysseus could already be somewhat confused. And then it casts huge doubts about the rest, like how should I consider the Acadian theory for the founding, the Rape of the Sabines, the monarchy and its overthrow, and the whole story about Cincinnatus ? Surely these stories have all elements of truth, like we know that Rome had kings, had Patrician/plebeian conflicts, and must have been warring with other nearby tribes and cities, yet without knowing where they come from I have no way to discern what's been invented and when from what is legitimate scientific consensus or theory."

Scripts say he ate from the tree which is a literal translation but the tree is a symbol of a different creation like we have family tree or race tree. The Devil lured them into that to change the DNA of sons of Adam and he succeeded but not all. Thus, we are not today all sons of Adam, some of us are a mix. Mostly Sons of Adam are good believers because they kept the original DNA of Adam."

Also, God is an Arabic word from the verb gad meaning to weave since the Lord weaved the two strands of DNA to make the new creation Adam. Also, Godio is the name of goat(can you see the resemblance Gadio/goat) therefore they portray God as goat out of ignorance of translating Arabic to Latin.

Too much ignorance in the west, dont you agree you need a new enlightenment by the Arabs since they lift no one else could produce a civilisation except when their bloodlines of Arabic Cananites came back to Andalusia and produced yet another civilisation?

You are worshipping the trinity belief system found by Arabs since right after Adam whereby Ishtar is the goddess, her son and the holy spirit blown into Adam(Roha in Arabic). The Syriac Arabs who fled western Arabia and settled in eastern med.then moved up to what is known today as Greece(from Arabic verb Grego meaning the refugee, the fugitive) they transferred their believes with them. To give you a heart attack, the cross sign which the Arabs made you believe in is nothing but a symbol of the goddess Ishtar who had been worshipped in all Arabic civilisations around the sunny/fertile med.shores for thousands of years. The letter ""t"" in Arabic represents the female ferility(Europa from Arab meaning fertile) and is a symbol of the goddess thus the eastern letter ""t"" that you believe is a cross has full ending signaling pregnancy of fertility whether the fertile earth that is pregnant with plant seeds or female pregnancy with living beings."

The alphabet that I write with right now is Arabic Cananite from western Arabia was given the name latin which is the feminine form of El(meaning goddess). Do you know who Elat(latin) is? I bet you dont. Elat is the name given to the goddess Ishtar the goddess of fertility(remember Arab meaning fertile and the Arabic queen""Europa"" means the fertile women). So basically, Elat(Latin) is the term giving to the Arabs who fled Athena(which is also an Arabic name) to establish Roma."

Some cities of the area was also strong military regional powers, like Taranto or Siracusa.It's obvious that Roman's had trade with them and by that, they started to share culture. You know, Greek civilization at the time was known as the finest thing ever. It was fashionable, it was wanted. Look at the Macedons like Philip the Second or Alexander the Great. They wasn't Greek but they wanted to be Greek to be recognized as ""civilized"" and ""powerful"". Same for Rome. At the time the Roman's was savages murderous bastards without glory nor good clothes or impressive monuments. Rome itself was a shithole made of dirt cabins and wooden stuff for the most wealthy.They wanted to improve their life, turn the city into something great and the first step to do it was to give her an identity, and a background.So Roman's started to give more attention to Greek culture, they also tracked down this story of Aenea to give to the founder fathers some nobility and the rest came from itself.You wonder why these myths about the foundation aren't all the same or someone is accepted and someone else it's not? It's simple: because they are all false. Fake stuff made just to make Rome more appealing to foreigners that have to invest on her. First and only great trade deal on Rome was Salt. Yes, salt. At the time salt was incredible useful to keep food safe from decaying and it wasn't cheaper. Roman's used to sell a lot of salt to the wealthy rich Greeks in the south. Through that trade they developed initially their city. And the Greeks? They figured out that was a shame having trade with poor people so they agreed in saying that Rome origins were true to be recognized too as the first who have found a great city of heroes and great men.""One hand wash the other and together wash the face"" its an old motto from Italy.

1178,UgyY6JcJ9faGtLsl0yt4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E,"I feel like you skipped the most realistic and likely theory on the founding of Rome - it being a small village founded by a group of Latins way before 753BC, gradually growing in population (with the name of “Rome” probably naturally developing through linguistic development of the local language) being influenced principally by Villanovan culture common on the Italic peninsula (as seen by wattle-and-daub huts) before becoming culturally influenced by the numerous Greek city-states in the south through various means.As far as I’m aware, this is usually the consensus of historians who study this field and is most in-line with reality and the evidence collectively compiled.Edit: another thing I forgot to mention - Rome was likely the creation of multiple villages through a process of synoecism. As these local communities grew, they likely converged on various matters (economic, cultural, political) that they became united making “Rome” grow to absorb all these small, local villages within the area. It wasn’t just the community on Palatinate Hill that “made” Rome - there were likely many villages around that all helped to develop Rome (villages which we have no name for). Those communities are definitely unsung heroes!"

The Cananites tribe who migrated from western Arabia where everything started from Adam til now took their stories with them. History had been re-written and mostly is full of lies.

Rima and Romel(without the arabic Syriac addition ""s"" which means the moon that is given to high ranking figures in the society) are both children of Arab Cananite who fled Athena to establish Roma(named after Rima/Rama/Roma which means Gazelle). Talia is the nanny who took care of them not a wolf hahaha. The reason why a white wolf is associated with the name Talia/Tali is because the word in Arabic has different meaning depending on the context so Talia is also the name of any white baby animal be it a wolf/sheep/goat"

1288,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E,Rome started with Romulus and finished with Romulus. So did Constantinople with two Constantines
1289,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg.9Ly4PtVtqv39PXJdfTknED,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg,"@Ghost Ghost That’s incorrect. Rome had existed as two emperors split in half, the western half fell around 400 A.D the eastern half fell in 1453."
1290,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg.9Ly4PtVtqv39OGNPpVFdNH,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg,Romams descended from Greeks. In the end the roman empire became Greek. The first settlement was built by the Arcadean Evander in the 12th century BC. Roman history begins in 753 BC but Rome constituted the expansion of an already existing Greek village. It was initially a city state. In 27 BC it became an empire. In 212 all subjects became Roman citizens. In 284 Rome was no longer the capital city of the empire. In 330 Constantinople became the capital city of the empire (again Constantinople constituted the expansion of the Greek colony of Byzantium). In 1453 Constantinople fell but the empire survived in the peloponnese until 1460.

1295,UgzNUU1T0e5Zz0yvBQ14AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E,u think thats a actual story that occurred? Within a week of info spreading in these times narrative changes. Now we think we know how the Roman Empire unfolded eons ago.There were countless empires. Yes countless. We only know less than 1 percent of actual history of the planet. We know nothing of anything trust me. The sarah desert was once a thriving city or dwelling b4 it became dry jus a a lil piece of history.

Sometimes it empowers stereotypes ect... because it is too simplistic that it muss the point as for a person that has no idea or knows no better might misunderstand. Your information in return sometimes not accurate enough cause how much oversimplifyed itis. You know things are not always simple. Yes you can try to simplify them. However,  like for example in calculus math you can't drive from a gradient. Definition of an equation beyond the slop means nothing. For someone that just started math it would mislead them. Just add more explanation points there and here where this is a possibility. Also for some topics it sounds you not very good at make more research. For example about the first Caliphate you didn't explain the political and militaristic nature it found itself in after prophet Mohammad death. You didn't know Persia hleped the rebellion against the Caliphate elected Government therefore it was targeted first and it was the main focus for a time. Also that there was alot of war declaration long ago during prophet Mohammad rule before becoming powerful and after actions of arrogance ect.. by the Romans and Persians. Especially the Persain ruler. This is just an example there is similar stuff happening with some other topic on your channel and other simplistic history  channels. Such as Crusades, WW2, cold war, Suni and Shia thing and other stuff i forgot. But there is alot of small point information that can be misinterpreted/misleading/misunderstood of important  ones and side ones that explain other things.

They were left to die in a basket near the river and saved by a wolf that nursed them and then by a shepherd. In adult age they will come back to kill their uncle and found their city, Rome."

It may have happened 10,000 years ago, or maybe even 3,000 years ago, but at some point in time, it seems the odds are that it happened.     There was likely nothing at all fair about life, until just recently.   I would even say that everyone then had PTSD, or some effect from it all.     It would be so fascinating to have a time-machine and go back to the time when homo sapiens had never heard of the myths that people cherish today.

It takes the myth and brings a practicality to the story. Like if it is true or even buts and pieces of it are true, this is what it would have looked like. Nothing supernatural about it, just men, women and children trying to figure it out way back then.Brutal yet honest alongside gorgeous cinematography makes this one a real stunner. It is in old Latin I think which; kudos to the actors- what an amazing job- so yes subtitles all throughout. But man oh man is it worth a go. At the very end you are on the edge of your seat waiting for him to say it- ROME! Brilliant movie! Check it out!"

When I watched ""The Passion"", the actors spoke classical Latin (a bit in a mechanical way, actually). I was able to follow the dialogs with the help of subtitles and some memory of High School...  It was not the case with this ""First King"" because the actors speak fluently (so, quickly); probably they made a lot of training. And the archaisms did the rest. I understood only simple sentences such as ""soli sumus"" (we are alone) or ""neca!"" (kill). During the viewing I also realized that some pronounciations were a bit different from what I remembered (ignis - fire - was spelled ig-nis with g and n separated, and not like in ""sign"", for example)"

1706,UgzUKNTqppKUsrXT8OV4AaABAg.8ypXLmLuEiy8yqttwsHEoy,UgzUKNTqppKUsrXT8OV4AaABAg,No it's not catchier title or anything. Roman Kings were seven and when you study history they refer to the first the second and so so on. So it's normal that a movie on Romolo the First king Is called like that
1707,Ugzmzxk94opBoaY2zdR4AaABAg,7TTuePHsN-c,Need more period movies. Not sure about this one tho. All they seem to do is fight.

Everyone in Italy would associate ‘the first king’ to Romulus, if you decontextualize it I assume it wouldn’t have much sense."

Those with half a brain, a decent concept of common sense and most people over 10 would not need to have this explained to them.    You want to see lack of brains, watch someone start an argument over what else it could have implied, rather than look at the direct evidence, circumstantial evidence and the actual title of the movie. Your response was pretty epic though.....well worth the read."

Anyway, the movie it's beautiful, if you can ,watch It,peace"
1726,Ugw6hFe-xsbx9Di347N4AaABAg.8yp1lFxzskM8yrBK1zmOOx,Ugw6hFe-xsbx9Di347N4AaABAg,"@Nyarlathotep-The Crawling Chaos No, it doesn't. It's contextual. Just like any other movie title. Take a title like ""The last Gunfighter."" In Wild West terms, the story is talking about one of the last gunfighters of that era. But many more people who fought with guns, who could also be called gunfighters, still exist after that Wild West persona. Therefore, in an Italian movie about the founding of Rome, they originally title it ""Il primo re"" translated as ""The First King"" but is also renamed as ""Romulus & Remus: The First King (2019)"" on IMDB as well, which further helps to contextualize the title of ""The First King"" moniker. Therefore, your argument is invalid."
