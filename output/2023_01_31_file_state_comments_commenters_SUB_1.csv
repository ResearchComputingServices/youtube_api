From them, the early Romans learned how to drain swamps, more advanced city planning, and more.However, as the Romans overthrew the last (and according to some sources; opressive) Etruscan king, they formed a republic to make sure that no man alone would rule Rome again.And they were successful, until Sulla."

Almost all of the Greek city states hated eachother, and so it is expected for them to call the Macedonians not Greeks. However, that doesn't make them not Greek. They are still just as Greek as all the other Greeks. And don't use the argument of democracy, because Sparta was also not democratic. And it doesn't matter if they viewed them as barbarians, they are just as civilized as all of the other Greeks. Different people hate eachother, simple. Are north and South Korea then also different cultures? They are by your logic, since they don't both have democratic values, they are viewed as pretty much barbarians (not literally) by the eachother, and they didn't use the same systems as eachother."

Put there to keep the romans under their controll, basicly imperialistic motives. And that this lead to the strong disgust romans shared for even the thought of having a king, when they became a republic. This can also be seen as to why Caesar was unable to take the title ""king"", even though ""dictator"" was aceptable.Anyway, i find this topic very interesting!"

I shall admit that it is a long time since i last looked into this, but i am going to se a consultor regarding my bachelor task tomorrow. He is UIO`s (the university where i study) foremost expert on romans and the greeks. I plan to take this topic upp with him, and I can post what he replies if you will."

They had different cultures (the romans took a lot from the etruscan people) and, most importantly, they saw themselves as different people. Calling them the same people is like arguing that Norwegians, Sweedish, Danish and German people ar all the same. Sure, the same type of people, but they do not see themselves as the same people."

558,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8LKvfSTBOcD,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@The New CaesarWell of course the Greeks influenced them, no doubt. The culture and society of Rome shared many similarities with citystates, and the Romans, at one point, even thought off their city as a form of greek city state. The republik was also formed after the democratic Greek ideal."
559,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8LKPR9dSJlo,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,InsertUsername I believe Greeks influenced Rome as well. I remember a book while back that the romans first used the phalanx but then adopted the maniple system.

695,Ugwf49B4Ms97oNorU594AaABAg,t6M5sFXKRcY,"Long ago in the kingdom of Alba longa lived a king named Numato, he was a magnificent ruler and had a beautiful daughter named Sylvia, Sylvia had a wicked brother Julius who overthrew Numato and took the throne for himself. Amilia speared that his niece would give birth to the sons who might try to retake the throne in the future, so he banished Sylvia to the temple of Mars to be a vestal virgin but Mars, the God of war fell in love with her and together they had twin sons, Remus and Romulus. Once the word got to Amelia's, he furiously ordered the servants to sneak into Mars's temple that night had killed the 2 babies but when the servants arrived at the temple, they couldn't bring themselves to harm the twins so instead they decided to send them away into the Tiber River so that Amelia's wouldn't know that they had lived. The river's currents were surprisingly calm. The babies did not drown infact the cradle drifted on to a bank just at the bottom of Palentine hill. The next morning a female wolf walked down the hill to get a drink at the river but when she did, she stumbled upon Remus and Romulus but instead of gobbling them up like any other wolf would do, she saved them and took them into her care like they were her own pups. When the boys grew up a shepherd names Posthumous found and took them from the Female Wolf and raised them. They grew up to be strong young men and would spread to the twin where the former king Numato had been banished to he realized that the boys were his grandsons and decided to have them come to him. When they arrived Numato explained to them everything that happened. He also informed them that they needed to overthrow Amelia's and take the throne from him. Romulus and Remus gathered an army of men, raided the kingdom and killed their wicked uncle. Once Numato was back on his throne, his grandsons decided that they wanted to start a city of their own but they were unable to decide where to build it so they decided to build their own separate cities but while they were building, Remus started to mock Romulus for having such low walls and leapt over them to prove his point. Romulus got angry and killed his brother in rage without hesitation and exclaimed, ""SO PERISH EVERYONE THAT SHALL HEREAFTER LEAP OVER MY WALL!"""

915,Ugx4rjkutnj3wjKPrPJ4AaABAg,_Ms-cwosvMI,"So I guess the shows world is build up like this: Instead of adapting Christianity and falling apart throughout the Dark Ages, the Roman Empire has survived and evolved to become our worlds super power. They have adapted Mithras Culture that originated from todays Iran (and was created by Aliens). But I cant find any discussion of that online"
916,Ugx4rjkutnj3wjKPrPJ4AaABAg.9FCMA4ub7b99FCTMsxPYsw,Ugx4rjkutnj3wjKPrPJ4AaABAg,"Thanks for the comment. It's my understanding that the discovery of the Scriptures at some point in the future led to Mithraism coming back. The world before this discovery, and it's history was just like ours. They have artificats from when Mithraism was popular, like Romulus' tooth, because they embrace the start of their religion. Someone decoded the scriptures and discovered all their technology (Necromancers, the Ark, the prison Helmets, the space drives that allowed them to cross space). And Campion Sturgess was born into a super wealthy Mithraic family and studied the scriptures. Then he changed sides and smuggled the tech to the atheists and at the same time he used his knowledge of the tech in the scriptures and money to build the spaceship and to reprogram Mother. I think Sol (the Kepler voice we have seen so far- i am thinking there will be 5 voices on Kepler, 1 in each of the 5 zones, associated with the each of the 5 temples and they are isolated in their zone. We will see the tropical zone next season and another temple and maybe another voice who now has a snake, which it let in through the core. The voice we heard all season wanted the snake on its side, thats why it told Paul to disable the lander) and then thats when Mithraism rose back to power because the scriptures related to Mithras and Sol and the Mithraic prophecies which in fact were just stories and technology from hundreds of thousands of years ago on Kepler. Sorry for the long response. The 5 temples and 5 voices is probably my next video. Thanks!"
917,UgxvbiAt-WcBcc_gCZp4AaABAg,_Ms-cwosvMI,Well that's depressing
918,UgxvbiAt-WcBcc_gCZp4AaABAg.9EtjyhrjuhG9EvVJGEoyCb,UgxvbiAt-WcBcc_gCZp4AaABAg,"@Nathaniel Bables Totally agree. I am curious as to why Sol wants Tempest's baby to live and be born on Kepler. It told Otho to knock her up, then warned Mother when she OD'd. It also distracted Father with a Tally vision so Tempest could kill the pregnant creature and eat it. Will the baby be normal? Or will being born on Kepler after beind exposed to its radiation cause it to mutate? Or maybe Sol is looking for more followers, and kids are the easiest to manipulate? I could do a whole video on that. I'm working on a ""What is Sol?"" video now, then I'll have to do ""What does Sol Want?"" Video...you know, other than snake babies"
919,UgxvbiAt-WcBcc_gCZp4AaABAg.9EtjyhrjuhG9EuaaJJUySQ,UgxvbiAt-WcBcc_gCZp4AaABAg,"@The Middle Man All of them have their pros and cons. Campons smart resourceful, but also hyper empathetic and over emotional. Paul is super focused, intelligent, refined, and dedicated. But is seemingly on the path to villain hood, though in this show morality is relative( specially if you objectively analyze Paul's motivations). And let's not get started on Hunter and Tempist."
920,UgxvbiAt-WcBcc_gCZp4AaABAg.9EtjyhrjuhG9Etteb9SvrR,UgxvbiAt-WcBcc_gCZp4AaABAg,"Paul killing Campion? Guess so, but that Campion kid is a bit annoying. And they could just be borrowing themes and not hitting it note for note. They also have a Cane and Abel vibe too, well, ok, it's a bit depressing. Lol"
921,Ugz2ntdhla_ERorb9xR4AaABAg,_Ms-cwosvMI,"This is a very good theory, and now with the season having ended, I still think this fits -  if not more. I love this show. Might just re-watch the season!"

927,UgxLyL4YvQDPYrdOKC14AaABAg,_Ms-cwosvMI,Very good theory! I definitely see the parallels between the two stories. My only question is going forward what role will Mother & Father play ? Also what will Marcus's character do?
928,UgxLyL4YvQDPYrdOKC14AaABAg.9EQ4EiDsUXO9EQ5XN0liej,UgxLyL4YvQDPYrdOKC14AaABAg,Good question. I think Marcus and Paul will team up and for a team against Campion and the others. Mother and Father are wild cards. They could just hunt the snake together along with whoever they run into in the tropical zone. Thanks for watching!

933,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg,_Ms-cwosvMI,Good theory! Any thoughts on Mother's fetus? Why does it need blood when Campion and his siblings didn't?
934,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg.9E9Hbt6bG0j9EAITrJy-q5,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg,@elwendigo2 Agreed on the blood. It doesn't make a lot of sense but definitely makes me think it's evil and probably why the planet is empty. I believe it sent formulas out into space to see if someone woild come back with a necromancer
935,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg.9E9Hbt6bG0j9EAIIAqPGCS,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg,@elwendigo2 Totally agree! In my episode 8 and 9 video i comment on the ship falling in maybe bringing it to life somehow as well
936,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg.9E9Hbt6bG0j9EAHz0DroeU,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg,"@The Middle Man okay, it doesn't make all of the sense but I could accept it. I don't know, I don't think they needed all that to stress the fact that it's half carbon based.Also drinking blood could be also added to the notion of it being evil, not explicitly but in our subconscious.Sim ""Campion"" seems not fond of humanity which is in line with the fetus reaction.Another thing that fell in the holes was Mother's ship itself! I don't know but the intelligence/voices could have got some information about mother from that"
937,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg.9E9Hbt6bG0j9E9cIDw_smm,Ugwda67nxBdVEgViKWZ4AaABAg,I think because the other fetus' were already human they didn't need the blood. Whatever is in Mother now is not human. It will be something different. A possible danger to humanity. It reacted negatively when Campion said hello to it.

956,Ugyc3L-bQfvnxSdXKLl4AaABAg,6n4BwU7rif4,Hi. I saw this on reddit. Nice video. Really informative. I think a way to expand the channel and get more shares and interaction would be to find a way to incorporate funny gags and jokes combined with some editing into the video but that's only if you can do the extra work (as I assume these videos take a lot of time) and if you want to stray a bit from the more serious side. Perhaps once all the civil wars kick off would be a good time. That's just my opinion. Do what you enjoy!!!!

979,UgiAhWgLWmI-tngCoAEC,6zSE40oXT-Q,"Fun historical tidbit: Rome probably predates the Romans, and was likely ruled by Etruscans first, basically a separate group of ancient Italians.  The killing of Remus may have been related to an Etruscan tradition about walls being built a certain way--specifically that jumping over a wall breaks a spell, the one who jumped the wall must be sacrificed to restore the protective magic.  Romulus and Remus may have been even more clearly 'Cain and Abel' types, their myth could have been an explanation of a gruesome sacrificial tradition carried out to protect the sanctity of city walls. (I guess the 'Fun' part is debatable huh?)"

And they all word it exactly the same way?The opposite would happen, everyone with access to the books would call him out for lying because the books didn’t have anyone named “Cain” or “Abel” in them.Moreover the Jews had every reason to despise him, and the Christians were still seen as enemies of the Roman Republic, so they wouldn’t like him either, and the Samaritans didn’t speak with Jews entirely."

And the Muslims adding it to the Quran?"
1174,UgyG22pJLZkS0R23unl4AaABAg.91ZR7UINGVc91cMwM8GI-i,UgyG22pJLZkS0R23unl4AaABAg,"@Segata Jonshiro Josephus is still a first century writer. I think you need to face the fact that it does not exist in older art, writing , or has an archeological basis. Romulus and Remus is probably an invention too considering a wall of Rome was discovered and is about 200 years older than the founding story.The jubilees is in a separate collection of the ""dead sea scrolls"".  Which some have combined into representing the same collection. The dating of that fragment is 1st ad still. If you read On Imitation, it becomes very clear what the Romans were doing at the time with literature."
1175,UgyG22pJLZkS0R23unl4AaABAg.91ZR7UINGVc91cAYzefyQD,UgyG22pJLZkS0R23unl4AaABAg,"Michael PierceNotice how none of the Romulus and Remus manuscripts get that old either?What’s your source on Cain and Abel not being in the DSS?“The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible” which is supposed to be directly translated from the DSS includes it, though it’s marked where words are missing.Here’s a section:[And a]gain [she] gave birth to his brother A[*bel. And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain wa]s a tiller of the ground. And in the course of time C[ain] brought an offering to the Lord [*from the fruit of the ground.]  4. And Abel also brought of the first[*lings of his flock and their fat portions. And]So the text is present but the scroll is heavily damaged, the brackets represent missing or unreadable text.Also Josephus in the 1st century wrote:“Adam and Eve had two sons: the elder of them was named Cain; which name, when it is interpreted, signifies a Possession. The younger was Abel; which signifies Sorrow. They had also daughters...”and“Whence it was that Cain was very angry that Abel was preferred by God before him, and he slew his Brother, and hid his dead body: thinking to escape discovery.”How was Josephus quoting this story before it existed? That makes no sense at all. Beyond this Josephus tells us he’s relating the story from the Torah, and the Septuagint. If it wasn’t present in these documents how could he make this claim and be taken seriously?"

There are also no contemporary sources for Romulus and Remus. But there are contemporary sources for the writers who described them both.Josephus describes Cain and Abel being in the book of Genesis in the 1st Century, and contemporary sources describe Josephus in the first century.He also describes the Septuagint being translated in the 3rd century BC, and the Old Testament being much older than that.If Dionysius can be confirmed via contemporary sources, so can the Septuagint and the New Testament, of which we have numerous first and second century sources that it existed prior to the Vaticanus, as well as hundreds of manuscript fragments that confirm that.In fact most scholars attribute the Cain and Abel story to the Jahwist source, and date it during the 6th century BC. This was a long time before Dionysius lived.Actually I think you may be wrong about Cain and Abel not appearing in the Dead Sea Scrolls, it appears the narrative is somewhat fragmentary, but it IS present."

Two paragraphs is too long for you to read?I’ll keep it simple: Show me a single Dionysus manuscript that predates the Vaticanus.The only reason for you to accept a BC composition date for Dionysius WITHOUT manuscript evidence, while at the same time denying a BC composition of the septuagint BECAUSE of a lack of manuscript evidence is pure bias.Apply the same standard to both works. Either Dionysius and the Septuagint can both conceivably predate manuscript evidence, or neither can."

And you'll understand why you should take any first century work with a grain of salt. There are many myths adapted into the ""Hebrew"" text associated with old myths.

Also the Cain and Abel Greek story shows textual evidence of having been a translation from a Semitic language originally, which argues strongly against it being a Greek invention entirely.But beyond ALL of that, the manuscript witnesses we have of the Septuagint version of the Cain and Abel story are actually older than the manuscript evidence of the Romulus and Remus story, and the primary reason we have the Romulus and Remus story is because Christians preserved the writings of the people like Pliny and Dionysius into the Middle Ages.The Sainaticus and Vaticanus May be from 300 ad. and be the oldest complete manuscripts, but we have an umpteen number of manuscripts and fragments from centuries before, which they largely agree with. No one argues for a 300ad composition date for the old and new testaments."

The Greek Septuagint is dated to the 3rd century BC and contains Cain and Abel, this date for the Septuagint is corroborated by a number of witnesses including Josephus in the 1st century.Moreover, Dionysius of Halicarnassus was born in the first century BC, not the third. Meaning he lived 200 years after the accepted date of the Septuagint. And the oldest Dionysius manuscript we possess is from the 10th century AD, 1000 years after he lived.The earliest manuscript of the Septuagint by comparison is from the 1st or 2nd century BC, a full 1200 years earlier.But even BEYOND that argument, are you really suggesting that one of these barely related stories has to be derivative from the other? As if no royalty ever has killed his brother before? Cain’s fratricide isn’t even related to the building of his city, the two events are far apart in time and Abel was not an aggressor against Cain.

They were not twins, they were not abandoned, they were not the children of a Virgin or of adultery of any kind, they did not kill a King, they were not bandits.Is the only similarity that they are brothers, and that Cain founded a city after killing Abel?

1328,Ugw2Y-WI7v_Buj6Vn-J4AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy LEGEND AND REALITYThe name Roma derives from the Etruscan name Ruma , an ancient goddess who had the ficus ruminalis as an attribute , sacred because the not yet ripe fig has a liquid similar to milk. The Pythagoreans also worshiped the fig fruit they carried in procession. In fact, a fig tree was perpetually at the foot of the Palatine. In short, the first Rome of the seven kings was above all Etruscan.The legend tells that Romulus and Remus were suckled under the fig tree, in reality the suckling fig comes from the Goddess Ruma to whom a small temple was dedicated next to the fig. Ruma or Rumina was the Etruscan-Roman goddess of infant feeding, to whom only libations of milk were dedicated.The name Ruma in fact means "" breast""and, like so many Etruscan names, turning into Latin they transform the"" u ""into"" o ""like the word"" rumax ""which becomes"" romanus ""in Latin. Thus Ruma becomes Rome.The legend tells that the two twins Romulus and Remus, abandoned in a basket on the Tiber river, they were suckled by a she-wolf who will in fact be the symbol of Rome. But the Goddess Lupa was also an ancient divinity, later assimilated to Acca Larentia, who was not a woman but the Goddess LupaIn its rites the priestesses practiced sacred prostitution, or ""hierodulia"" imitating the verse of the she-wolf. On the other hand, the goddess of Etruscan fertility ""Feronia"", venerated at the foot of Mount Soratte, in Lucus Feroniae, by Latini, Sabini and Falisci, was a she-wolf goddess.In ancient Rome, the derogatory term ""she-wolf"" remained to indicate a prostitute, the term ""brothel"" for brothels and the cry of the wolf that Roman prostitutes, no longer sacred, made to lure patrons.Acca Larentia was therefore not a woman, as the patriarchate tells, but a goddess, in fact the Larentalia were celebrated in Rome on December 23rd, and Augustus then ordered that the party be performed twice a year.Akka in Sancrito means ""mother"". Therefore Acca Larenzia was the Mater Larum or "" Mother of the Lares "", and the Lares were the protector ancestors for the Romans, including Romulus and Remus of course.In fact, during the Laurentalia, sacrifices were offered to the Lares, cult of Etruscan origin, the spirits of the ancestors, who protected the gens, the extended family nucleus. More important than the family was in fact for the Roman the Gens from which he came, the one that could give prestige and fame, as well as protection. In fact it came even before the proper name: Julius Caesar belonged to the illustrious Gens Iulia (Giulia).In the land of the Sabines, a Goddess Larenta, or Larunda, the ""Dea Muta"" of the world of the dead, or rather of the ancestors, was worshiped."
1329,UgzMyb8V3_WyeXQrl-t4AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy DEATH OF REMUS AND FOUNDATION OF ROMERomulus and Remus then left Alba Longa and went to the bank of the Tiber to found a new city in the place where they were born and raised.Livio reports two versions:Since they were twins and respect for the birthright could not function as an elective criterion, it was up to the gods who protected those places to indicate, through the auspices, who they had chosen to give the name to the new city and who should reign there after the foundation. Thus, to interpret the auspicious signs, Romulus chose the Palatine and Remus the Aventine. The first omen, six vultures, it is said was Remo's turn. Since twice as many had appeared to Romulus by the time the omen had been announced, the respective groups had proclaimed both king at the same time. Some argued that they had the right to power based on priority over time, the others based on the number of birds seen. A discussion arose and from the angry word fight it turned to blood: Remo, hit in the fray, fell to the ground.The version according to which Remus, in order to make fun of his brother, would have climbed over the newly erected walls and then Romulus, at the height of anger, would have killed him, adding these words of defiance, is more well known: ""So, from now on then, whoever dares to climb over my walls may die ». In this way Romulus seized power by himself and the newly founded city took the name of its founder.The version of Plutarch, in "" Life of Romulus "" is similar to that of Livy, with the variant that Romulus would not have seen any vulture. His victory would have been the result of deception, for which Remo was angry and the dispute arose that led to his death.When Remus realized that his brother had made fun of him, he was indignant and while Romulus was digging the moat with which he intended to surround the city walls, he scoffed at his work and tried to hinder him.Finally he crossed the moat, but fell hit in that same spot, according to some by Romulus himself, according to others by a companion of Romulus, Celere. In the fight also fell Faustulus and Plistinus, who is said to be Faustulus's brother and had helped to raise Romulus and Remus.According to others, Romulus had a wall built on the furrow (urvus, from which Urbs = city) traced with the plow, placing Celere as guard, to whom he gave the order to kill anyone who dared to climb over it. Unfortunately Remo had not learned of the order imposed by his brother and when he approached the wall, noticing how low it was, he jumped over it. The faithful Celere rushed at him and pierced him with the sword. Romulus, learned of the misfortune, was shocked by it, but did not dare to cry in front of his people, being by now a sovereign.In a widespread tradition, by the local peoples, the twins were granted a land that was equivalent to the perimeter of a heifer skin. The twins were not discouraged: they meticulously skinned a large animal and made it into very small strips, placing them one after the other. The furrow of the pomerium was traced on those borders of skin. Surely it alludes to a sacrificial rite of the heifer.It is very reminiscent of the myth of Cadmus who went to the Oracle of Delphi to find out where he should have founded the city of Thebes. The prophecy was: ""Choose from the bellowing cows the one that has a white full moon pattern on both sides. Take it as your guide on the road you will have to travel. Where the cow will kneel and first place its horned head on the ground, at that point you will have to sacrifice it to the earth plunged into darkness. After having sacrificed her, she founds on a hill, the highest, a city with wide streets . ""The allusion to the moon and the heifer suggest legacies of the Mother Goddess I, or Europa, the heifer. THE POMERIUMThe ancient cities, both Latin and Etruscan, required a magical religious ritual for the foundation. The center of the city, the ""mondus"", was established through the priests, tracing a furrow around it and sacrificing a heifer, a symbol of fertility, to delimit the sacred area.Then various religious symbols were buried in the ""mundus"", including the Lares and the Penates, as well as statuettes of the gods protectors of the city. The mundus became for the Romans Hades, or the kingdom of the dead.In this enclosure, called the pomerium or pomerius, only temples or sacred areas could be built, for which a second groove was traced, intended for the government of the people, that is the palace, the comitio, the forum etc.Outside of this one could build for citizenship, and then the fields followed. The walls were then arranged on the furrow. The sacred enclosure delimited and defined the Urbs, the city consecrated to the Gods and therefore unassailable and invincible. Only cities with a pomerium were Urbes. The others were Oppida, deprived of divine protection.The ancient Pelasgian cities are in fact built with three concentric walls of walls (see Artena, Norba etc.). The first with the great temple, the second with the palace and the agora, the third to protect houses and fields.In the legend, Remus is killed by Romulus, probably armed, because he crosses the sacred furrow, thus committing a profanation of the pomerium, a profanation that was paid for with death.Remus was buried on the Aventine in a place called Remoria, in memory of which a Remuria (or Lemuria) feast is celebrated every 9 May to remember the dead as Ovid tells us. Romulus was thus the first king of Rome."
1330,UgxNpCph5u-1PhNtrCt4AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy THE LEGENDAmulius ousted his brother Numitor to reign alone on Albalonga, killing his sons and forcing his daughter Rhea Silvia to become a vestal because he did not procreate heirs to his throne.The God Mars, however, saw the girl while she drew water in the sacred wood and raped her, making her pregnant with twins: Romulus and Remus.Amulius had her condemned and died because she had violated the vow of chastity, but the river Aniene, where the body was thrown, took pity on her and resurrected her. King Amulius, to save them, had the children placed in a basket, entrusting it to the current.Due to the rains the Tiber had overflowed (which it will do until the twentieth century with the new embankments built for a good eight meters high), flooding the fields of the Velabro, and on that bank, called Cermalus, the basket stopped. Then the waters receded and the twins found themselves at the foot of a fig tree (ficus ruminalis).For others the basket stopped in a cave at the base of the Palatine Hill, called ""Lupercale"" because it was sacred to Mars and Faun Luperco.A she-wolf, who came down from the mountains to the river to drink, attracted by the cries of the two children, joined them and nursed them. A woodpecker also brought them food, and the woodpecker was sacred to Mars. They were then found by a shepherd named Faustolo, the swineherd of Amulio, who together with his wife Acca Larenzia decided to raise them as children. The hut of Faustolo and Laurenzia was on the Palatine, in the ""Germalo"" area.Plutarch tells (Life of Romulus):It is said that the twins were brought to Gabii to learn the use of writing and everything that children of noble origins usually have to learn .. they were called Romulus and Remus in reference to the breast ... of the she-wolf ... Romulus seemed to possess greater capacity of judgment and an innate political perspicacity, showing in the relations with the neighbors for the right to graze and hunting a natural predisposition to command rather than to submission.And Livio adds (Ab Urbe condita):Strengthened in body and spirit, they not only faced the beasts, but ambushed bandits laden with booty. They shared the spoils of the robberies with the shepherds and shared serious and playful things with them, while the number of young people grew day by day. The twins were then attacked by bandits who wanted to take revenge on the loot they had stolen from them earlier. Romulus was saved, but Remus was captured and led by King Amulius, accused of theft in the lands of the king's brother, so he was brought to Numitor for him to judge. After several questions Numitor recognized his nephew while Romulus arrived and told him the family story. So the two brothers together with some companions killed Amulius and returned the throne of Albalonga to Numitore."
1331,Ugy1eTYOznd_HfbY6R94AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy THE URBE« I don't know if it is really worthwhile to tell the whole of Roman history from the very beginning. Even if I knew it, I would not dare to say it, because I realize that it is an operation as ancient as it is practiced, while modern historians either believe that they can make some more documented contribution in the narration of the facts, or that they can overcome the crudeness of the facts. antique in the field of style. Whatever happens, it will still be worthy of gratitude that I have taken steps, within the limits of my ability, to perpetuate the memory of the deeds accomplished by the greatest people on earth. ""(Tito Livio, Ab Urbe condita, Praefatio, 1-3.)It seems that the first urban agglomeration settled on the Tiberina Island, reachable by fording, and later by means of a bridge, expanding on the Palatine hill around the 10th century BC, the Esquiline and Quirinal hills were subsequently occupied. Along the banks of the Tiber, up to Ostia, between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, there were many villages, each based on a hill, down to the sea.Before the ""foundation of Rome"", there was therefore a village on the Palatine, or on two heights: the Germalus and the Palatium, separated by a depression called ""intermontium"", and on the Velia, continuation of the Esquiline, between the Palatine and Opium.The other settlements on the surrounding hills will refer to this village:- the Esquiline, with the Cispius to the north, Oppius to the south and Fagutalis to the west;- the Celio, formerly Querquetulanus for the sacred oak grove, then Caelius by the Etruscan hero Celio Vibenna;- the Suburra da suburbio, sub urbe, on the slopes of Quirinale;- the Viminale towards the Esquiline.Over time these settlements are organized into a league, with federal bonds, the Saeptimontium (the seven mountains), or the league ""of the Seven Hills"". In reality there are only two hills, the rest are mountains. THE SEVEN HILLS    Aventine - Mons Aventinus;    Palatine - Mons Palatinus;    Quirinale - Collis Quirinalis, with the secondary hills of Colles Latiaris, Mucialis and Salutaris;    Viminal - Collis Viminalis;    Celio - Mons Caelius, with the eastern extension of the Celiolo or Caeliolus;    Esquilino - Mons Esquilinus;    Campidoglio - Mons Capitolinus, with the peaks Arx to the north and Capitolium to the south, separated by the ""saddle"" of the Asylum.They report that King Numa Pompilius celebrated, in May and December, a procession along all seven hills, with sacrifices on the 27 tombs of the Argei. Which shows that at the time Rome already collected the seven hills.According to Varro, the Argei were heroes following Hercules, who took away the Lazio lands from the Sicilian and Ligurian tribes and settled in a village, the Campidoglio, "" founded by the God Saturn "".The celebration was reserved first to the Latins, then to the Sabines of the Quirinale and then to the whole city. The myth of Hercules and his heroes suggests a patriarchal society that has replaced a matriarchal culture, as Bachofen demonstrated with his studies on Roman finds in the book ""The Matriarchy"". It is no coincidence that Hercules strangled snakes in his cradle that were the symbol of every Mother Goddess."
1332,Ugy3Abe4--so0UBe8Il4AaABAg,heZoGPlncDk," emoji_Italy FIRST ROMAN SETTLEMENTSThe oldest settlements of what will later become Rome date back to very remote times, even to Neanderthal man. The oldest seems to be in the Valchetta area, with human remains from 65,000 years ago, another in via di Torre Spaccata from 60,000 years ago.We move on to the Iron Age with the arrival of the Latins of Indo-European descent, therefore not indigenous, first a Latin-Faliscan group and then an Umbrian-Sabello group. Those same Latins who met Aeneas, according to tradition, when, fleeing from Troy, he landed in Lazio. Rome was formed with the fusion of many different people, because where different civilizations converge there is an exchange that amplifies knowledge.No civilization can boast a mass of people and races like Rome, a point of connection between the West and the East, also because it stretches out both on the river and on the sea. In ancient times the ground was covered with forests and dangerous for wild beasts, coast-to-coast navigation, or by river, was the least dangerous way to move.The Falisci occupied the Tiber valley, between the Cimini mountains and the Sabatini mountains, while the Latins occupied the Latium vetus, the ancient Lazio, which ran from the right bank of the Tiber to the Alban Hills, bordering the Etruscans north of the Tiber. The Volsci, and in part the Ernici, instead occupied the south of Lazio; the Aurunci, and a little the Rutuli, the Lazio Campana coast; the Sabines the Apennine area to the north, the Equi to the east. It is probable that the Hellespontus in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) contributed to the union of cultures, when around 1100 BC, Troy fell and the survivors took refuge in Lazio.Excavations at the Foro Boario have uncovered some Greek pottery from the 8th century BC which already showed commercial relations with the Hellenic colonies at the time.The Palatine huts, of which there are numerous traces, had a shape between the rectangular and the elliptical, in all similar to those of the hut urns of the same period, found in the archaic burial ground of the Forum, which were used to contain the ashes of the deceased and they imitated the house where he had lived.The large holes along the edge and in the center were used to house the support poles of the roof, while smaller holes, on both sides of the doorway, had to support a particular and light cover in front of the door itself.The traces of the hearth were very clear next to the central hole.Their dating is from the 8th century BC, that is, fully corresponding to the date of the foundation of Rome, moreover, the remains of a palace have recently been found.The prehistoric tombs next to the foundations of the disappeared Arch of Augustus, in the Roman Forum, a culture similar to the proto-Villanovan one, with unadorned vases, probably from the 1st millennium BC, in the Bronze Age, testify to these settlements. A necropolis necessarily derives from a village of permanent dwellings.Another testimony is the necropolis next to the temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina with prehistoric burials, also in the Roman Forum, next to villages of huts, ranging from the 9th to the 8th century. BC, then reserved only for children's tombs until the 7th century BCThe ancient inhabitants of Rome inhumed, unlike the later Romans who mainly incinated the dead. Burial is characteristic of matriarchal or matriarchal societies, while cremation is patriarchal and nomadic. Which means that the ancestors of Rome were matriarchal, in fact returning the body to the earth presupposes a devotion to Mother Nature or Earth.Still finds from the Bronze Age in the area of ​​Sant'Omobono, at the church of Sant'Omobono, at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, with two temples, of the Dea Fortuna and of the Mater Matuta, from the sixth century. BC, two primordial Goddesses worshiped as Mothers of the pantheon, in short, Great Mothers of the Gods.The two twin temples were built on the area already occupied by protohistoric huts and only one has been excavated because the second is under the church. The Goddess Fortuna is the Greek Ananke, against whom, as Homer says, the Gods can do nothing, or the Roman Fatum, the one who guides the fortunes. It is no coincidence that in Palestrina there was the temple, Cicero talks about it, of Fortuna Primigenia, in whose temple lots were cast, that is, the dice to predict the future.In the center of Rome almost all the churches are built on pagan temples, to make people forget the old gods and because the people there used to go there. In addition, it was possible to take advantage of the marbles and columns. The famous Cosmatesque pavements so frequent in Roman churches are nothing more than Roman marbles that have been broken up and reassembled according to a design, and many of the columns are ancient Roman. To get an idea just visit the Pantheon where the gigantic Roman marbles are preserved intact.It seems that the temple of Fortuna dates back to Servius Tullius, and sacred prostitution, or Ierodulia, was practiced there, which was used throughout the Mediterranean and in all ancient civilizations, especially as a female priesthood (the male one is rarer). The sanctuaries were abandoned in the 4th century BC, with the end of the Etruscan monarchy."

Romulus' birth by a virgin woman, going to heaven without dying and reappearing to a person to command him to spread Rome and conquer the world echoes Jesus' story. Maybe Jesus' story was based on Romulus' story. Maybe the Israelites under the Roman rule wanted to create a story similar to the Rome's origin story with little changes to mock them....like how the Kingdom of Rome began with their King Romulus, the Kingdom of God/Israelites would begin with their King of the Jews, the Messiah, Jesus Christ whose story is very similar to the Romulus' story"

However the romans usually used the nickname ""lupa"" ( = she-wolf) for the prostitutes (and the brothels were called ""lupanar"", like the famous one at Pompeii); hence the supposition that the she-wolf of the myth was actually Acca Larentia and that she was a prostitute."

1580,Ugz-C1ukkiMu6iBHqWN4AaABAg,Q6miiEjN_NU,Filme müssen kein Actionfeuerwerk sein um gut zu sein. Das heutige Kino macht sowieso fast alles falsch. Gibt ja fast nur noch filme für verblödete Red Bull saufende Komerz Kids. Sorry aber das ist meine Meihnung  und ich bin ein echter Filmfreak. In den 80ern ging ich noch fast jede Woche ins Kino und sah so manchen Film bis zu 5 mal im Kino. Heute ist es eher so 1 mal im jahr und dann sind es meist Filme die nur 2 Wochen laufen - für die wirklich guten Filme intressiert sich meist keine breite Masse. Ich gebe dem film aufjedenfall eine Chnage. Schlechte Kritik erhöht in der heutigen Zeit mein Intresse immer !!!

2384,UgztzHpsJxmCkhRkq0t4AaABAg,NVMDk61aZTU,I am really confused.I loved the movie and went on to search more about them and googled a lot and found out that the real reason Romulus killed Remus was because Remus jumped over the wall that Romulus built as they had a bet regarding some birds and Remus lost his right to be a Rome guy as he showed no any moral virtues and traits by jumping over the wall and Romulus killed him.And the movie shows a different story and Romulus is shown as really a weak character in this movie which makes me doubt it.

2414,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg.9Fntac2Fklf9ZWQY8d-G0f,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg,"@Crue Shaw Obviously, archaic Latin was closer to Proto Indo-European (a hypothetical Indo-European language spoken in the Euro-Asian steppes around 5000 BC ...). According to ethnologists these populations (who were very aggressive) moved towards western Europe subduing the various local populations and imposing their own language on them. After a few millennia there was no longer the memory of these invasions and Europe was divided into several distinct groups who were unaware of having a common linguistic origin."
2415,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg.9Fntac2Fklf9KaLvK295BD,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg,The latins were actually a neighbor of the newly founded kingdom under Romulus. It would take alot of wars and time to pass before the latin people and their language were fully assimilated into rome. What they speak I believe is a kind of form of proto-latain but its much more crude almost seeming to have hints of multiple ancient very ancient languages with everything from German to slavic.
2416,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg.9Fntac2Fklf9Iqk5C21QD9,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg,"It is the Italian pronunciation of Latin, the whole cast is Italian actors"

2419,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg.9Fntac2Fklf9Fod2-Waiyk,Ugw__P3KTgNCsvuXsg14AaABAg,"@Marius Dimcea well, Romanian is a romance language albeit with a lot of Slavic words into it, so it's not that weird. We could even say that Romanian words are more similar to their original source than the italian ones. For instance I can't grasp much in what the actors are saying here. By the way the authors made a series from the same concept, Romulus, it's out now, great show"

Sometimes the term latin is used to refer to people in some european country who speak any of this languanges, but not very often, I guess.These languanges and the apphabet that they created are a kind of legacy left by them to today's people.Even languanges like english received some influence by the ancient latin and greek.This movie seems to be surely fantastic."

This is true.

(as it is described by this film ...), or rather like in the Neolithic period ... without advanced technical and engineering knowledge, without a state organization, without written laws, without even practicing writing! etc. etc. Do you understand? ...

They were dozens of tribes spread out cross europe, from northern Italy to northern Britain, speaking similar languages (like romance languages speakers today). They had a similar culture but again they were  divided in small populations . For instance one of the tribe that conquered Greece were probably Celts... The same Gauls that went to Anatolia ...Celts were certainly (not every Tribe) a society... I mean, they were much more sophisticated than history thought...

Even the Greeks and Romans did not believed that (see how Alexander took great length to guarantee the Celtic Confederation would not threaten his back before leaving for Asia, hence the alliance which would bring 80 000 celtic warriors in Greece during the Diadochi Wars). The fact that Romans practiced systematic destruction / ""damnatio memoriae"" helped forget what was there (France, Spain, Germany, etc.) before. Art, literature, science weren't greek or roman privileges (see the many, many amazing european pieces of art that are neither roman nor greek and often precede them by centuries), as modern archeology has proven. Considering engineering for example, ""polyeurcétique"" (sorry i don't know the english word, meaning ""art of doing a siege"") was known by greeks and romans themselves to be a celtic special skill (with the gallic wall, war machines, processes etc.), paved roads (you know the so-called roman ones) are celtic too (Hallstatt to La Tène era), mining idem, etc. For politics, the parliament system of the Celts may have preceded the greek one, scholars still debating on this due to lack of written evidences. It sometimes coexisted with monarchy, with elected kings and elected assemblies, long before modern monarchies."

There were the Celts , the etruscans, the umbrians , the venetians (and many historicians say that the central/ northern italians were part of the same European family , latins included ) but Greeks and then romans gave the modern term of civilization.

And that's the prowess of the romans, they endured the struggle and succeeded in putting together peoples far more refined than them (Etruscans, Siculo-greeks, Celts, Iberians, ...) thus creating a great civilisation by mixing it all together. Should it be called Roman ? Nope, that was my point. In Europe we are bound by school to the myth of the romans bringing civilisation to the world, to the point it becames dangerous : all that preceded roman invasions is considered inexistant by non-history-oriented people, for example most europeans think their ancestors lived in huts, dressed in animal skin and beat their women before roman invasion. Forcing the trait here (we're on YT, not IRL debating for hours) but you get the point : on a sociological, religious (christian religion as we know it being a roman creation) and political level it's disastrous, and obvious when you compare roman conquered countries to others, and i think much can be learned for the time being and those to come by studying how roman influence brought the better and the worse to european peoples."

Romans absorbed everything that could be useful from the people they met, thus developing their own engineering, art, culture etc managing to create the first global society in history if mankind, that spanned across Europe, North Africa and Middle East.And the legacy of Greek-Roman world survives untill today.Nothing against other civilizations, but first the Greek and later the Roman civilization were immensely superiors."

I've also read what other romans had to tell about the Gallic Wars (Pliny the Elder and others), and what Greeks had to say about the northerners.If i recall correctly it was Hecateus who talked of Pyrene, the famed ""big city"" of the Celts, and Nyrax, a merchant city. Still unfound, but one oppidum may be it : Heidengraben, 1800 hectares inside walls, 150 hectares for the ""acropolis"", and that at times when Rome was a microscopic city-state struggling with its neighbours. Rome would reach such a sheer size during octavian times, several centuries later. Only Carthago and Athens were approx the same size (2000 ha and 1600 ha IIRC) by celtic times.Wooden and rounded villages yes, and they wore animal skin and leather armor, and washed themselves once in a lifetime. Oh wait, that's Hollywood depiction of it, must surely be true ! As other Hollywood depictions XD Some of the greatest jewelry treasures of ancient times BCE ever found are celtic, amongst them the biggest bronze vase ever, and ladies stuff of a rare level of refinement (of course, ladies had rights to choose their husband, have a business etc. in celtic ""barbarian"" culture, while roman ladies were under the authority of their father of husband).

2489,UgzX3tb-NryjroZKnR54AaABAg.924y-SKGz78939M6MczFfD,UgzX3tb-NryjroZKnR54AaABAg,"​@stig hansen ""the Romans dragged primitive Europe out of the Stone Age"" haha nice joke.For the record Stone age ended around 800 BCE in Europe, at that time the Greeks of the archaic period talked about splendors in the north, and Heidengraben was already a 300 hectares city with a princely / royal necropolis.Rome was not even a wish at that time, and farmers in Latium-to-be still used stone tools.When the Brennus army sacked Rome in 390 BCE, romans were still using bronze arms and armor, except for the very elite, while the ""barbarian"" celts fought with iron swords, protected by chainmail, their own invention used for centuries all over the world.That exact Rome, light of the world, that the ""barbarians"" sacked in 390 covered roughly 400ha, city, suburbs and fields altogether, while at the exact same time, at least 10 other cities in celtic Europe covered 350ha or more each, inside walls, and were only capitals, not city-states : Manching, Alcimoennis, Camulodunon, Heuneburg, and others i don't remember the names. Some of them had public hot baths, you know the ""roman invention"". And Heidengraben had reached 1800 hectares inside walls with a 150 hectares inner-city / acropolis. Carthage never exceeded that size, and Rome would reach it 2 centuries later, during the 1st century CE. The largest entrance in Heidengraben walls was 7m large and 35m long, to give some perspective.Around 100 BCE when some celts, divided by civil wars caused by demographics and lack of free lands (not really a sign of primitiveness when you begin to lack of fields for food), started a long migration, the so-praised roman army was wiped out in a couple years, not once, but twice, depriving Rome of 40-60% of the able males. And the celtic fighters were mostly armed civilians, women included. They inflicted the Roman legions the worst ever defeat in history, in terms of losses per hour : 120 000 KIA in 4 hours (Battle of Arausio, in today's France). The Romans lost a total close to 240 000 legionaries KIA in less than a year. Such a disaster it brought a guy, Marius, to power, to reform farming methods, military recruitment and training, and even citizenship conditions. And there would be much more to say about that precise period, but it would be long. You can search about the Tolosa Treasure, the romans captured it then lost it, and were strongly looking after it, even 2 centuries later : still unfound, it was 70 tons of gold and close to 400 tons of silver, by today standards it's approx 3,7 billions $. Not bad for primitives.50 years later, a descendant of the roman general defeated at Arausio swore to avenge him, restore his mother's name, and bring back the gold : Julius Caesar. He spread the light of civilisation by slaughtering hundreds of thousands of civilians during the ""Bello Gallico"", even other romans talked of a ""crime against the human kind"" (Pliny the Elder, Appien, ...). 1/10 of the Gauls were killed during the war, another 1/10 deported and / or enslaved. And the romans rapidly adopted the military equipment of the gauls, amongst other things : the chainmail, the segmented armor, the helmet, the shoes, the saddle, ...The cultural enlightment was such that during the so-called ""Pax Romana"", their was at least 1 rebellion every 17 years in celtic countries, and several ""independances"". They surely wanted another slice of civilisation."

Unlike many other adaptations, in which Romulus and Remus are portrayed as two brave men who founded Rome for the survival of their people, in this novel both brothers are just immature brats whose actions are motivated by pure fun. At first, both youngsters spend the day dressed as wolves and playing pranks on the inhabitants of the village where they live. When their pranks end up causing King Amulius to imprison Remus and Romulus had to rescue him by killing the ruler, the two brothers realize how much fun it is to conquer other towns. With the help of their group of followers, who are also immature kids, Romulus and Remus decide to start attacking other villages and also decide to turn their own home into a city, just to ""know what might come of it"". Even after creating Rome and killing Remus, Romulus, already as king, continues with his immature attitude and decides to organize the Rapture of the Sabines, not to repopulate the city, but to troll the Sabines and have a good laugh at them. However, Romulus ends up paying for his impertinence when, after 40 years reigning, the senators get fed up with his carefree attitude and assassinate him. Literally, if this Romulus had seen what the city he created would end up becoming long after his death, he would have said: ""It was just a prank, bros...""  emoji_crying_face "

Sumerian knows and able to calculate eclipse of the sun more than 10000 years ago before Thales,  They were able to create their own alphabet (also it is based on Turan language family) , they were the first engineer, captain, farmer, lawyer in the civilization. we understand that you dont want to accept that there is Turan civilization under west civilization. Because all your imperial idea is going to collapse. So you try to make fake Greeks civilization (they have no culture /civilization to make their own alphabets) . Etruscans had their own alphabets (this affets Romans and they borrowed it from them and create Latin language)  that there are 6 lettters as same as Göktürk alphabet (Orhun monuments, about 5-6 centuries) , and there are 2 of them only in Gökturk and Etruscans alphabet."

Greece tried to make everyone Hellenistic. Persia is the only empire that did not destroy other cultures or religions, it respected all. Therefore they are glorified in the Bible and Greece and Rome r not. When Persia defeated Babylon they allowed the defeated king to remain in power, they kept Babylonian customs. Babylon had to only pay taxes in return. They did the same with Egypt etc. Alexander did the opposite he tried to make Egypt Hellenistic. Similar to what Arabs did to many parts of Middle East, or what Anglo saxons did to native Americans, enforce their culture and annihilate what they encounter. Persia never did that. They respected others, ppl were free under Persian rule. This was not the case within Greek city states. So the idea of evil Persians trying to destroy Greece is laughable. Alexander did more destruction to Greece than the Persians. Look up destruction of Thebes. by modern standards Persia was far ahead everyone incl. ancient Greece in terms of religious freedom (the Jews loved Persia) human rights, women rights, labor rights etc. It would take the rest of the world 2500 years to catch up.But u continue to live in your fairy tale. western distortion of history will be exposed.

2580,Ugy8Q-6m9cYd8ElnEYV4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy LEGEND AND REALITYThe name Roma derives from the Etruscan name Ruma , an ancient goddess who had the ficus ruminalis as an attribute , sacred because the not yet ripe fig has a liquid similar to milk. The Pythagoreans also worshiped the fig fruit they carried in procession. In fact, a fig tree was perpetually at the foot of the Palatine. In short, the first Rome of the seven kings was above all Etruscan.The legend tells that Romulus and Remus were suckled under the fig tree, in reality the suckling fig comes from the Goddess Ruma to whom a small temple was dedicated next to the fig. Ruma or Rumina was the Etruscan-Roman goddess of infant feeding, to whom only libations of milk were dedicated.The name Ruma in fact means "" breast""and, like so many Etruscan names, turning into Latin they transform the"" u ""into"" o ""like the word"" rumax ""which becomes"" romanus ""in Latin. Thus Ruma becomes Rome.The legend tells that the two twins Romulus and Remus, abandoned in a basket on the Tiber river, they were suckled by a she-wolf who will in fact be the symbol of Rome. But the Goddess Lupa was also an ancient divinity, later assimilated to Acca Larentia, who was not a woman but the Goddess LupaIn its rites the priestesses practiced sacred prostitution, or ""hierodulia"" imitating the verse of the she-wolf. On the other hand, the goddess of Etruscan fertility ""Feronia"", venerated at the foot of Mount Soratte, in Lucus Feroniae, by Latini, Sabini and Falisci, was a she-wolf goddess.In ancient Rome, the derogatory term ""she-wolf"" remained to indicate a prostitute, the term ""brothel"" for brothels and the cry of the wolf that Roman prostitutes, no longer sacred, made to lure patrons.Acca Larentia was therefore not a woman, as the patriarchate tells, but a goddess, in fact the Larentalia were celebrated in Rome on December 23rd, and Augustus then ordered that the party be performed twice a year.Akka in Sancrito means ""mother"". Therefore Acca Larenzia was the Mater Larum or "" Mother of the Lares "", and the Lares were the protector ancestors for the Romans, including Romulus and Remus of course.In fact, during the Laurentalia, sacrifices were offered to the Lares, cult of Etruscan origin, the spirits of the ancestors, who protected the gens, the extended family nucleus. More important than the family was in fact for the Roman the Gens from which he came, the one that could give prestige and fame, as well as protection. In fact it came even before the proper name: Julius Caesar belonged to the illustrious Gens Iulia (Giulia).In the land of the Sabines, a Goddess Larenta, or Larunda, the ""Dea Muta"" of the world of the dead, or rather of the ancestors, was worshiped."

2582,UgzA6CsAF0lFQzx2Vnd4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy DEATH OF REMUS AND FOUNDATION OF ROMERomulus and Remus then left Alba Longa and went to the bank of the Tiber to found a new city in the place where they were born and raised.Livio reports two versions:Since they were twins and respect for the birthright could not function as an elective criterion, it was up to the gods who protected those places to indicate, through the auspices, who they had chosen to give the name to the new city and who should reign there after the foundation. Thus, to interpret the auspicious signs, Romulus chose the Palatine and Remus the Aventine. The first omen, six vultures, it is said was Remo's turn. Since twice as many had appeared to Romulus by the time the omen had been announced, the respective groups had proclaimed both king at the same time. Some argued that they had the right to power based on priority over time, the others based on the number of birds seen. A discussion arose and from the angry word fight it turned to blood: Remo, hit in the fray, fell to the ground.The version according to which Remus, in order to make fun of his brother, would have climbed over the newly erected walls and then Romulus, at the height of anger, would have killed him, adding these words of defiance, is more well known: ""So, from now on then, whoever dares to climb over my walls may die ». In this way Romulus seized power by himself and the newly founded city took the name of its founder.The version of Plutarch, in "" Life of Romulus "" is similar to that of Livy, with the variant that Romulus would not have seen any vulture. His victory would have been the result of deception, for which Remo was angry and the dispute arose that led to his death.When Remus realized that his brother had made fun of him, he was indignant and while Romulus was digging the moat with which he intended to surround the city walls, he scoffed at his work and tried to hinder him.Finally he crossed the moat, but fell hit in that same spot, according to some by Romulus himself, according to others by a companion of Romulus, Celere. In the fight also fell Faustulus and Plistinus, who is said to be Faustulus's brother and had helped to raise Romulus and Remus.According to others, Romulus had a wall built on the furrow (urvus, from which Urbs = city) traced with the plow, placing Celere as guard, to whom he gave the order to kill anyone who dared to climb over it. Unfortunately Remo had not learned of the order imposed by his brother and when he approached the wall, noticing how low it was, he jumped over it. The faithful Celere rushed at him and pierced him with the sword. Romulus, learned of the misfortune, was shocked by it, but did not dare to cry in front of his people, being by now a sovereign.In a widespread tradition, by the local peoples, the twins were granted a land that was equivalent to the perimeter of a heifer skin. The twins were not discouraged: they meticulously skinned a large animal and made it into very small strips, placing them one after the other. The furrow of the pomerium was traced on those borders of skin. Surely it alludes to a sacrificial rite of the heifer.It is very reminiscent of the myth of Cadmus who went to the Oracle of Delphi to find out where he should have founded the city of Thebes. The prophecy was: ""Choose from the bellowing cows the one that has a white full moon pattern on both sides. Take it as your guide on the road you will have to travel. Where the cow will kneel and first place its horned head on the ground, at that point you will have to sacrifice it to the earth plunged into darkness. After having sacrificed her, she founds on a hill, the highest, a city with wide streets . ""The allusion to the moon and the heifer suggest legacies of the Mother Goddess I, or Europa, the heifer. THE POMERIUMThe ancient cities, both Latin and Etruscan, required a magical religious ritual for the foundation. The center of the city, the ""mondus"", was established through the priests, tracing a furrow around it and sacrificing a heifer, a symbol of fertility, to delimit the sacred area.Then various religious symbols were buried in the ""mundus"", including the Lares and the Penates, as well as statuettes of the gods protectors of the city. The mundus became for the Romans Hades, or the kingdom of the dead.In this enclosure, called the pomerium or pomerius, only temples or sacred areas could be built, for which a second groove was traced, intended for the government of the people, that is the palace, the comitio, the forum etc.Outside of this one could build for citizenship, and then the fields followed. The walls were then arranged on the furrow. The sacred enclosure delimited and defined the Urbs, the city consecrated to the Gods and therefore unassailable and invincible. Only cities with a pomerium were Urbes. The others were Oppida, deprived of divine protection.The ancient Pelasgian cities are in fact built with three concentric walls of walls (see Artena, Norba etc.). The first with the great temple, the second with the palace and the agora, the third to protect houses and fields.In the legend, Remus is killed by Romulus, probably armed, because he crosses the sacred furrow, thus committing a profanation of the pomerium, a profanation that was paid for with death.Remus was buried on the Aventine in a place called Remoria, in memory of which a Remuria (or Lemuria) feast is celebrated every 9 May to remember the dead as Ovid tells us. Romulus was thus the first king of Rome."
2583,Ugxg3uDULCY__bMtQQR4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy THE LEGENDAmulius ousted his brother Numitor to reign alone on Albalonga, killing his sons and forcing his daughter Rhea Silvia to become a vestal because he did not procreate heirs to his throne.The God Mars, however, saw the girl while she drew water in the sacred wood and raped her, making her pregnant with twins: Romulus and Remus.Amulius had her condemned and died because she had violated the vow of chastity, but the river Aniene, where the body was thrown, took pity on her and resurrected her. King Amulius, to save them, had the children placed in a basket, entrusting it to the current.Due to the rains the Tiber had overflowed (which it will do until the twentieth century with the new embankments built for a good eight meters high), flooding the fields of the Velabro, and on that bank, called Cermalus, the basket stopped. Then the waters receded and the twins found themselves at the foot of a fig tree (ficus ruminalis).For others the basket stopped in a cave at the base of the Palatine Hill, called ""Lupercale"" because it was sacred to Mars and Faun Luperco.A she-wolf, who came down from the mountains to the river to drink, attracted by the cries of the two children, joined them and nursed them. A woodpecker also brought them food, and the woodpecker was sacred to Mars. They were then found by a shepherd named Faustolo, the swineherd of Amulio, who together with his wife Acca Larenzia decided to raise them as children. The hut of Faustolo and Laurenzia was on the Palatine, in the ""Germalo"" area.Plutarch tells (Life of Romulus):It is said that the twins were brought to Gabii to learn the use of writing and everything that children of noble origins usually have to learn .. they were called Romulus and Remus in reference to the breast ... of the she-wolf ... Romulus seemed to possess greater capacity of judgment and an innate political perspicacity, showing in the relations with the neighbors for the right to graze and hunting a natural predisposition to command rather than to submission.And Livio adds (Ab Urbe condita):Strengthened in body and spirit, they not only faced the beasts, but ambushed bandits laden with booty. They shared the spoils of the robberies with the shepherds and shared serious and playful things with them, while the number of young people grew day by day. The twins were then attacked by bandits who wanted to take revenge on the loot they had stolen from them earlier. Romulus was saved, but Remus was captured and led by King Amulius, accused of theft in the lands of the king's brother, so he was brought to Numitor for him to judge. After several questions Numitor recognized his nephew while Romulus arrived and told him the family story. So the two brothers together with some companions killed Amulius and returned the throne of Albalonga to Numitore."
2584,UgyuE9V4Dv65DTKoLg54AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy THE URBE« I don't know if it is really worthwhile to tell the whole of Roman history from the very beginning. Even if I knew it, I would not dare to say it, because I realize that it is an operation as ancient as it is practiced, while modern historians either believe that they can make some more documented contribution in the narration of the facts, or that they can overcome the crudeness of the facts. antique in the field of style. Whatever happens, it will still be worthy of gratitude that I have taken steps, within the limits of my ability, to perpetuate the memory of the deeds accomplished by the greatest people on earth. ""(Tito Livio, Ab Urbe condita, Praefatio, 1-3.)It seems that the first urban agglomeration settled on the Tiberina Island, reachable by fording, and later by means of a bridge, expanding on the Palatine hill around the 10th century BC, the Esquiline and Quirinal hills were subsequently occupied. Along the banks of the Tiber, up to Ostia, between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, there were many villages, each based on a hill, down to the sea.Before the ""foundation of Rome"", there was therefore a village on the Palatine, or on two heights: the Germalus and the Palatium, separated by a depression called ""intermontium"", and on the Velia, continuation of the Esquiline, between the Palatine and Opium.The other settlements on the surrounding hills will refer to this village:- the Esquiline, with the Cispius to the north, Oppius to the south and Fagutalis to the west;- the Celio, formerly Querquetulanus for the sacred oak grove, then Caelius by the Etruscan hero Celio Vibenna;- the Suburra da suburbio, sub urbe, on the slopes of Quirinale;- the Viminale towards the Esquiline.Over time these settlements are organized into a league, with federal bonds, the Saeptimontium (the seven mountains), or the league ""of the Seven Hills"". In reality there are only two hills, the rest are mountains. THE SEVEN HILLS    Aventine - Mons Aventinus;    Palatine - Mons Palatinus;    Quirinale - Collis Quirinalis, with the secondary hills of Colles Latiaris, Mucialis and Salutaris;    Viminal - Collis Viminalis;    Celio - Mons Caelius, with the eastern extension of the Celiolo or Caeliolus;    Esquilino - Mons Esquilinus;    Campidoglio - Mons Capitolinus, with the peaks Arx to the north and Capitolium to the south, separated by the ""saddle"" of the Asylum.They report that King Numa Pompilius celebrated, in May and December, a procession along all seven hills, with sacrifices on the 27 tombs of the Argei. Which shows that at the time Rome already collected the seven hills.According to Varro, the Argei were heroes following Hercules, who took away the Lazio lands from the Sicilian and Ligurian tribes and settled in a village, the Campidoglio, "" founded by the God Saturn "".The celebration was reserved first to the Latins, then to the Sabines of the Quirinale and then to the whole city. The myth of Hercules and his heroes suggests a patriarchal society that has replaced a matriarchal culture, as Bachofen demonstrated with his studies on Roman finds in the book ""The Matriarchy"". It is no coincidence that Hercules strangled snakes in his cradle that were the symbol of every Mother Goddess."
2585,Ugzl-NQfHMtYS0IOTXJ4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E," emoji_Italy FIRST ROMAN SETTLEMENTSThe oldest settlements of what will later become Rome date back to very remote times, even to Neanderthal man. The oldest seems to be in the Valchetta area, with human remains from 65,000 years ago, another in via di Torre Spaccata from 60,000 years ago.We move on to the Iron Age with the arrival of the Latins of Indo-European descent, therefore not indigenous, first a Latin-Faliscan group and then an Umbrian-Sabello group. Those same Latins who met Aeneas, according to tradition, when, fleeing from Troy, he landed in Lazio. Rome was formed with the fusion of many different people, because where different civilizations converge there is an exchange that amplifies knowledge.No civilization can boast a mass of people and races like Rome, a point of connection between the West and the East, also because it stretches out both on the river and on the sea. In ancient times the ground was covered with forests and dangerous for wild beasts, coast-to-coast navigation, or by river, was the least dangerous way to move.The Falisci occupied the Tiber valley, between the Cimini mountains and the Sabatini mountains, while the Latins occupied the Latium vetus, the ancient Lazio, which ran from the right bank of the Tiber to the Alban Hills, bordering the Etruscans north of the Tiber. The Volsci, and in part the Ernici, instead occupied the south of Lazio; the Aurunci, and a little the Rutuli, the Lazio Campana coast; the Sabines the Apennine area to the north, the Equi to the east. It is probable that the Hellespontus in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) contributed to the union of cultures, when around 1100 BC, Troy fell and the survivors took refuge in Lazio.Excavations at the Foro Boario have uncovered some Greek pottery from the 8th century BC which already showed commercial relations with the Hellenic colonies at the time.The Palatine huts, of which there are numerous traces, had a shape between the rectangular and the elliptical, in all similar to those of the hut urns of the same period, found in the archaic burial ground of the Forum, which were used to contain the ashes of the deceased and they imitated the house where he had lived.The large holes along the edge and in the center were used to house the support poles of the roof, while smaller holes, on both sides of the doorway, had to support a particular and light cover in front of the door itself.The traces of the hearth were very clear next to the central hole.Their dating is from the 8th century BC, that is, fully corresponding to the date of the foundation of Rome, moreover, the remains of a palace have recently been found.The prehistoric tombs next to the foundations of the disappeared Arch of Augustus, in the Roman Forum, a culture similar to the proto-Villanovan one, with unadorned vases, probably from the 1st millennium BC, in the Bronze Age, testify to these settlements. A necropolis necessarily derives from a village of permanent dwellings.Another testimony is the necropolis next to the temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina with prehistoric burials, also in the Roman Forum, next to villages of huts, ranging from the 9th to the 8th century. BC, then reserved only for children's tombs until the 7th century BCThe ancient inhabitants of Rome inhumed, unlike the later Romans who mainly incinated the dead. Burial is characteristic of matriarchal or matriarchal societies, while cremation is patriarchal and nomadic. Which means that the ancestors of Rome were matriarchal, in fact returning the body to the earth presupposes a devotion to Mother Nature or Earth.Still finds from the Bronze Age in the area of ​​Sant'Omobono, at the church of Sant'Omobono, at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, with two temples, of the Dea Fortuna and of the Mater Matuta, from the sixth century. BC, two primordial Goddesses worshiped as Mothers of the pantheon, in short, Great Mothers of the Gods.The two twin temples were built on the area already occupied by protohistoric huts and only one has been excavated because the second is under the church. The Goddess Fortuna is the Greek Ananke, against whom, as Homer says, the Gods can do nothing, or the Roman Fatum, the one who guides the fortunes. It is no coincidence that in Palestrina there was the temple, Cicero talks about it, of Fortuna Primigenia, in whose temple lots were cast, that is, the dice to predict the future.In the center of Rome almost all the churches are built on pagan temples, to make people forget the old gods and because the people there used to go there. In addition, it was possible to take advantage of the marbles and columns. The famous Cosmatesque pavements so frequent in Roman churches are nothing more than Roman marbles that have been broken up and reassembled according to a design, and many of the columns are ancient Roman. To get an idea just visit the Pantheon where the gigantic Roman marbles are preserved intact.It seems that the temple of Fortuna dates back to Servius Tullius, and sacred prostitution, or Ierodulia, was practiced there, which was used throughout the Mediterranean and in all ancient civilizations, especially as a female priesthood (the male one is rarer). The sanctuaries were abandoned in the 4th century BC, with the end of the Etruscan monarchy."

To all that territories were imposed the latin language and then it evolve into several dialects, and when the countrys were formed they chose one dialect between  the various inside their land to be the national language like the portuguese, spanish, french, italian and romanian. so the other latin derived dialects were repressed to be spoken and they began to fade since then. It was the second time this happened the first time was when the latin was imposed and the former languages that were spoken like celtic ones began to fade; it is thought that they weren´t to diferent at that time to the latin since both decend from the same proto language.3) All true, when the latin derived languages were brought to america the roman empire there wasn't anymore but the newly cultures derive from it.4) Greece, Switzerland, Belgium, England, Germany  were not imposed to speak the latin language like greece because the greek language was a literature language for the romans that learned. the other ones i don't know much about it, i can guess that the romans doesn't imposed with too much strenght their culture and language to them."

We also know Evander founded it and it later fell into Pelasgian kingship (Etruscan). It most likely became a city state 750 BC, when laws for Greek city states were established. Romans were of Greek descent continuing their Hellenic culture with their own flavour just as Aeolian Greek is the root to Latin which it morphed into. The Romans kept myth and the Greeks kept their history. Another reason why the Greeks did not find offence to Roman rule. Their lives did not change and their taxes were paid regardless of who it went to."

Sometimes it empowers stereotypes ect... because it is too simplistic that it muss the point as for a person that has no idea or knows no better might misunderstand. Your information in return sometimes not accurate enough cause how much oversimplifyed itis. You know things are not always simple. Yes you can try to simplify them. However,  like for example in calculus math you can't drive from a gradient. Definition of an equation beyond the slop means nothing. For someone that just started math it would mislead them. Just add more explanation points there and here where this is a possibility. Also for some topics it sounds you not very good at make more research. For example about the first Caliphate you didn't explain the political and militaristic nature it found itself in after prophet Mohammad death. You didn't know Persia hleped the rebellion against the Caliphate elected Government therefore it was targeted first and it was the main focus for a time. Also that there was alot of war declaration long ago during prophet Mohammad rule before becoming powerful and after actions of arrogance ect.. by the Romans and Persians. Especially the Persain ruler. This is just an example there is similar stuff happening with some other topic on your channel and other simplistic history  channels. Such as Crusades, WW2, cold war, Suni and Shia thing and other stuff i forgot. But there is alot of small point information that can be misinterpreted/misleading/misunderstood of important  ones and side ones that explain other things.

And then it casts huge doubts about the rest, like how should I consider the Acadian theory for the founding, the Rape of the Sabines, the monarchy and its overthrow, and the whole story about Cincinnatus ? Surely these stories have all elements of truth, like we know that Rome had kings, had Patrician/plebeian conflicts, and must have been warring with other nearby tribes and cities, yet without knowing where they come from I have no way to discern what's been invented and when from what is legitimate scientific consensus or theory."

Filip is an Arabic name originally Flilith(the Kanan's P took the place of Aramic th) and it is referring to Pi sign in math worthing 3.14 as a constant number but where did it come from? It came from dividing 22/7 with 22 being the number of Alphabets in old Syriac Arabic and 7 is the miraculous number of days, skies, earths..etc. also 22 is the number of amino acids in the cell of all living beings but what does 3.14 mean? 3 is the number of all basic things for example you need 3 genes to be coded in the cell and you take any Arabic word to a 3 letter root verb.. there are many more astonishing facts but vast majority are not exposed to to media's interests of distorting history."

The whole history started with Arabs from Adam whos name is Arabic from the root Dm meaning the like or the copy since he was created of the image of God. Also, God is an Arabic word from the verb gad meaning to weave since the Lord weaved the two strands of DNA to make the new creation Adam. Also, Godio is the name of goat(can you see the resemblance Gadio/goat) therefore they portray God as goat out of ignorance of translating Arabic to Latin.

Bro Arabs just Adopted you after 10000 years of religion/civilisation when the snow melted and gave you their latest book(the bibel) and you think you are something. Hahah.

Do you now understand the difference between south of Italy and north(the alps and its Germanic snow people). Too much ignorance in the west, dont you agree you need a new enlightenment by the Arabs since they lift no one else could produce a civilisation except when their bloodlines of Arabic Cananites came back to Andalusia and produced yet another civilisation?

You are worshipping the trinity belief system found by Arabs since right after Adam whereby Ishtar is the goddess, her son and the holy spirit blown into Adam(Roha in Arabic). The Syriac Arabs who fled western Arabia and settled in eastern med.then moved up to what is known today as Greece(from Arabic verb Grego meaning the refugee, the fugitive) they transferred their believes with them. To give you a heart attack, the cross sign which the Arabs made you believe in is nothing but a symbol of the goddess Ishtar who had been worshipped in all Arabic civilisations around the sunny/fertile med.shores for thousands of years. The letter ""t"" in Arabic represents the female ferility(Europa from Arab meaning fertile) and is a symbol of the goddess thus the eastern letter ""t"" that you believe is a cross has full ending signaling pregnancy of fertility whether the fertile earth that is pregnant with plant seeds or female pregnancy with living beings."

The alphabet that I write with right now is Arabic Cananite from western Arabia was given the name latin which is the feminine form of El(meaning goddess). Do you know who Elat(latin) is? I bet you dont. Elat is the name given to the goddess Ishtar the goddess of fertility(remember Arab meaning fertile and the Arabic queen""Europa"" means the fertile women). So basically, Elat(Latin) is the term giving to the Arabs who fled Athena(which is also an Arabic name) to establish Roma."

Talia is the nanny who took care of them not a wolf hahaha.

2946,Ugwpu6VN6aVJeR0uLwh4AaABAg.9M-BydPPeCG9airXdWYH5z,Ugwpu6VN6aVJeR0uLwh4AaABAg,"@Tyler Durden well it's simple: South Italy was colonized by Greeks at the time. Some cities of the area was also strong military regional powers, like Taranto or Siracusa.It's obvious that Roman's had trade with them and by that, they started to share culture. You know, Greek civilization at the time was known as the finest thing ever. It was fashionable, it was wanted. Look at the Macedons like Philip the Second or Alexander the Great. They wasn't Greek but they wanted to be Greek to be recognized as ""civilized"" and ""powerful"". Same for Rome. At the time the Roman's was savages murderous bastards without glory nor good clothes or impressive monuments. Rome itself was a shithole made of dirt cabins and wooden stuff for the most wealthy.They wanted to improve their life, turn the city into something great and the first step to do it was to give her an identity, and a background.So Roman's started to give more attention to Greek culture, they also tracked down this story of Aenea to give to the founder fathers some nobility and the rest came from itself.You wonder why these myths about the foundation aren't all the same or someone is accepted and someone else it's not? It's simple: because they are all false. Fake stuff made just to make Rome more appealing to foreigners that have to invest on her. First and only great trade deal on Rome was Salt. Yes, salt. At the time salt was incredible useful to keep food safe from decaying and it wasn't cheaper. Roman's used to sell a lot of salt to the wealthy rich Greeks in the south. Through that trade they developed initially their city. And the Greeks? They figured out that was a shame having trade with poor people so they agreed in saying that Rome origins were true to be recognized too as the first who have found a great city of heroes and great men.""One hand wash the other and together wash the face"" its an old motto from Italy. You can figure out what it means. Don't be ""americans""..."

2984,UgyY6JcJ9faGtLsl0yt4AaABAg,HCXA0bok9-E,"I feel like you skipped the most realistic and likely theory on the founding of Rome - it being a small village founded by a group of Latins way before 753BC, gradually growing in population (with the name of “Rome” probably naturally developing through linguistic development of the local language) being influenced principally by Villanovan culture common on the Italic peninsula (as seen by wattle-and-daub huts) before becoming culturally influenced by the numerous Greek city-states in the south through various means.As far as I’m aware, this is usually the consensus of historians who study this field and is most in-line with reality and the evidence collectively compiled.Edit: another thing I forgot to mention - Rome was likely the creation of multiple villages through a process of synoecism. As these local communities grew, they likely converged on various matters (economic, cultural, political) that they became united making “Rome” grow to absorb all these small, local villages within the area. It wasn’t just the community on Palatinate Hill that “made” Rome - there were likely many villages around that all helped to develop Rome (villages which we have no name for). Those communities are definitely unsung heroes!"

Talia is the nanny who took care of them not a wolf hahaha. The reason why a white wolf is associated with the name Talia/Tali is because the word in Arabic has different meaning depending on the context so Talia is also the name of any white baby animal be it a wolf/sheep/goat"

3096,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg.9Ly4PtVtqv39OGNPpVFdNH,UgwMHx7GJ8Bd13cMojh4AaABAg,Romams descended from Greeks. In the end the roman empire became Greek. The first settlement was built by the Arcadean Evander in the 12th century BC. Roman history begins in 753 BC but Rome constituted the expansion of an already existing Greek village. It was initially a city state. In 27 BC it became an empire. In 212 all subjects became Roman citizens. In 284 Rome was no longer the capital city of the empire. In 330 Constantinople became the capital city of the empire (again Constantinople constituted the expansion of the Greek colony of Byzantium). In 1453 Constantinople fell but the empire survived in the peloponnese until 1460.

Sometimes it empowers stereotypes ect... because it is too simplistic that it muss the point as for a person that has no idea or knows no better might misunderstand. Your information in return sometimes not accurate enough cause how much oversimplifyed itis. You know things are not always simple. Yes you can try to simplify them. However,  like for example in calculus math you can't drive from a gradient. Definition of an equation beyond the slop means nothing. For someone that just started math it would mislead them. Just add more explanation points there and here where this is a possibility. Also for some topics it sounds you not very good at make more research. For example about the first Caliphate you didn't explain the political and militaristic nature it found itself in after prophet Mohammad death. You didn't know Persia hleped the rebellion against the Caliphate elected Government therefore it was targeted first and it was the main focus for a time. Also that there was alot of war declaration long ago during prophet Mohammad rule before becoming powerful and after actions of arrogance ect.. by the Romans and Persians. Especially the Persain ruler. This is just an example there is similar stuff happening with some other topic on your channel and other simplistic history  channels. Such as Crusades, WW2, cold war, Suni and Shia thing and other stuff i forgot. But there is alot of small point information that can be misinterpreted/misleading/misunderstood of important  ones and side ones that explain other things.

Vez cual es la importancia de ilustrarse en una universidad a diferencia de escuchar you tubers, no digo que you tuber no sirva al contrario aportan muchísimo pero hay que tener cuidado con lo que aprendemos porque no todo lo que se dice literalmente es cierto."

3643,UgwLnuSR1Jpj31qqsZN4AaABAg,zHN6HIjD9Y0," emoji_Italy  emoji_winking_face LEGEND AND REALITYThe name Roma derives from the Etruscan name Ruma , an ancient goddess who had the ficus ruminalis as an attribute , sacred because the not yet ripe fig has a liquid similar to milk. The Pythagoreans also worshiped the fig fruit they carried in procession. In fact, a fig tree was perpetually at the foot of the Palatine. In short, the first Rome of the seven kings was above all Etruscan.The legend tells that Romulus and Remus were suckled under the fig tree, in reality the suckling fig comes from the Goddess Ruma to whom a small temple was dedicated next to the fig. Ruma or Rumina was the Etruscan-Roman goddess of infant feeding, to whom only libations of milk were dedicated.The name Ruma in fact means "" breast""and, like so many Etruscan names, turning into Latin they transform the"" u ""into"" o ""like the word"" rumax ""which becomes"" romanus ""in Latin. Thus Ruma becomes Rome.The legend tells that the two twins Romulus and Remus, abandoned in a basket on the Tiber river, they were suckled by a she-wolf who will in fact be the symbol of Rome. But the Goddess Lupa was also an ancient divinity, later assimilated to Acca Larentia, who was not a woman but the She-Wolf Goddess.In rites the priestesses practiced sacred prostitution, or ""hierodulia"" imitating the verse of the she-wolf. On the other hand, the goddess of Etruscan fertility ""Feronia"", venerated at the foot of Mount Soratte, in Lucus Feroniae, by Latini, Sabini and Falisci, was a she-wolf goddess.In ancient Rome, the derogatory term ""she-wolf"" remained to indicate a prostitute, the term ""brothel"" for brothels and the cry of the wolf that Roman prostitutes, no longer sacred, made to lure patrons.Acca Larentia was therefore not a woman, as the patriarchate tells, but a goddess, in fact the Larentalia were celebrated in Rome on 23 December, and Augustus then ordered that the party be performed twice a year.Akka in Sancrito means ""mother"". Therefore Acca Larenzia was the Mater Larum or "" Mother of the Lares "", and the Lares were the patron ancestors for the Romans, including Romulus and Remus of course.In fact, during the Laurentalia, sacrifices were offered to the Lares, cult of Etruscan origin, the spirits of the ancestors, who protected the gens, the extended family nucleus. More important than the family was in fact for the Roman the Gens from which he came, the one that could give prestige and fame, as well as protection. In fact it came even before the proper name: Julius Caesar belonged to the illustrious Gens Iulia (Giulia).In the land of the Sabines, a Goddess Larenta, or Larunda, the ""Dea Muta"" of the world of the dead, or rather of the ancestors, was worshiped."

Mostly it’s me posed in those mosaics that I drew over with my ipad.  I also incorporated elements from real ancient mosaics and art work.  I’ve referenced them in the description, so you can see how I incorporated them.  I’m not particularly good at drawing, but I’ve tried to make my limitations part of my style.  It just takes a long time to make though, that and a full time job means I can’t release videos very often.

Until four years the pantheon still had its god statues and firence was a beautifull place. Ever heard of the ships of the gods that sailed a lake and were a temple for the gods well as the colloseum(that was a theatre, no fights ever occoured there) stood all intact untill 5 years ago. Ihave to repeat that the invention of the vatican is only four years old and was never a reality. Only propagated by a shitty group of assholes that made shit movies and shat the  media full with lies. May the gods bewith you"

Armies are obeying me goods are moving really free Governments efficient and there's PAX ( Latin word for peace) No more of these Punic Wars fighting over Sicily Hannibal crossed the Alps Still Carthage couldn't beat Scipio Africanus and Hannibal had elephants!

We got concrete to build arch bridges We got baths where you read and talk business Build the Colosseum fill the Colosseum get some gladiators Let the lions eat them You know the Roman Empire's growing Got to keep the conquered people from revolting All of them should know the laws plebeians and slaves will See them in the forum and say ""They're the 12 tables"" I'm ""One who commands"" Ruling all provinces in my Empire Build aqueducts and say my name's ""Augustus""       It's the Pax Romana Im ""One who Commands"" Ruling all provinces in my Empire Build aquaducts and say my name's ""Augustus"" It's the Pax Romana Seven hills protect us from invasion Fertile Farmland is in the plains of Latium Volcanoes, they sometimes erupt like mount Vesuvius Pompeii was sad but their soil's rich The Italian peninsula on Mediterranean trade routes You'll see that it's shaped like a boot My non-citizen soldiers still defend us Every 5 yrs we count the people with a census Your servants' Your slaves, Your brothers, Your babies We're going to take a census soggy ready 'cause we're counting up the numbers Edit: I literally can't finish this PS: no copy and paste"

5204,UggKoYfpi1KOJ3gCoAEC,m5V-IK1cEtE,you should make another song with the tune of rollin by limp bizkit
5205,UgjVucFhUPOrb3gCoAEC,m5V-IK1cEtE,Romano: GRANDPA. NO. STOP. YOUR TO OLD FOR THIS. GRANDPA STOP.Rome: But this is so fun ^.^
5206,UgjatM9wtCulGHgCoAEC,m5V-IK1cEtE,it's epic!!!
5207,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,m5V-IK1cEtE,Hannibal would have destroyed rome if he hadn't turned back becuase carthage needed him
5208,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8ghIABqilIY,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,Christopher is right he didnt have the ability there was no way he would ever be able to take Rome and he was Annihilated by Scipio
5209,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8b36_SUEzaI,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,"Ajmer Thethy hannibal lose Punic war because while he remained in capuae like a moron ,romans repelled carthaginian from Spain and defeated Syracusae , and even in Italy Hannibal lose battles , he was never able to defeat Marcellus , and lose an italian cities one by one , before his came back to africa barricaded at crotona."
5210,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8FkfAVZ1USw,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,"Well, if Hannibal hadn't pulled back to Carthage he would have done some really cool shit. He massacred the Rkmans largest army due to superior war tactics. Hannibal was too op for the Romans. The Romans and western civillization should be thankful that Hannibal pulled back."
5211,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8FkYJhQQFnV,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,Assaulting a fortified position is much more difficult than you may think. Also the Carthaginian troops weren't superior per se. It was mainly due to tactics and the fast moving Numidian cavalry that led to Hannibal's victories. Within the city streets the Romans could have simply formed defensive lines and tactics/the Numidian cavalry would be rendered inoperable.
5212,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8FkVBCFA_l4,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,"Are you kidding me? Hannibal was slaughtering the Romans all over Italy. If he hadn't stopped, he would have made his way towards Roma and probably burn it down, like the Romans did to Carthae."
5213,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC.8A8ItEBH-eH8FIzeZG2XGj,Ugh6Yb68IDpmZngCoAEC,"Hannibal did not have the manpower or siege artillery/equipment to adequately attack the city of Rome itself. Keep in mind the city of Rome itself was heavily garrisoned with a huge force of Hastati, Princepes and Triarii. To take the city itself would be suicidal. Had his brother managed to march from Hispania to Latium then maybe yes he would have had the manpower. However Publius Scipio (not yet Africanus) soundly defeated him not too far from Nova Carthago."

They were left to die in a basket near the river and saved by a wolf that nursed them and then by a shepherd. In adult age they will come back to kill their uncle and found their city, Rome."

It may have happened 10,000 years ago, or maybe even 3,000 years ago, but at some point in time, it seems the odds are that it happened.     There was likely nothing at all fair about life, until just recently.   I would even say that everyone then had PTSD, or some effect from it all.     It would be so fascinating to have a time-machine and go back to the time when homo sapiens had never heard of the myths that people cherish today.

It takes the myth and brings a practicality to the story. Like if it is true or even buts and pieces of it are true, this is what it would have looked like. Nothing supernatural about it, just men, women and children trying to figure it out way back then.Brutal yet honest alongside gorgeous cinematography makes this one a real stunner. It is in old Latin I think which; kudos to the actors- what an amazing job- so yes subtitles all throughout. But man oh man is it worth a go. At the very end you are on the edge of your seat waiting for him to say it- ROME! Brilliant movie! Check it out!"

When I watched ""The Passion"", the actors spoke classical Latin (a bit in a mechanical way, actually). I was able to follow the dialogs with the help of subtitles and some memory of High School...  It was not the case with this ""First King"" because the actors speak fluently (so, quickly); probably they made a lot of training. And the archaisms did the rest. I understood only simple sentences such as ""soli sumus"" (we are alone) or ""neca!"" (kill). During the viewing I also realized that some pronounciations were a bit different from what I remembered (ignis - fire - was spelled ig-nis with g and n separated, and not like in ""sign"", for example)"

Take a title like ""The last Gunfighter."" In Wild West terms, the story is talking about one of the last gunfighters of that era. But many more people who fought with guns, who could also be called gunfighters, still exist after that Wild West persona. Therefore, in an Italian movie about the founding of Rome, they originally title it ""Il primo re"" translated as ""The First King"" but is also renamed as ""Romulus & Remus: The First King (2019)"" on IMDB as well, which further helps to contextualize the title of ""The First King"" moniker.

You just took some historical liberties, and twisted them in a way to get your point across. He wasn't called Alexander of Greece, or Ellada, because there was no Greece back then. There were Greek city-states. They were divided yes, but they were all Greek. He isn't called Alexander of Greece, just like Archimedes isn't referred as Archimedes of Greece, but Archimedes of Syracuse, or Eudoxus who is referred as Eudoxus of Knidos. The fact that he wasn't called Alexander of Greece, doesn't mean that he wasn't Greek. It's because Greece didn't exist back then. He wasn't called Alexander of Greece, but he was called Strategos Autokrator of Greece. Sratigos in greek means commander, and autokrator emperor. So he was basically called Emperor Commander of Greece. Furthermore, he believed that he was descended from Herakles from his father's side, and Achilles from his mother's side. Both are Greek mythical heroes. He worshiped Greek gods, especially Zeus who he was particularly fond of, because his mother would often tell him that he was his father. Also, his ancestors come from Argos, a city in Peloponnese, Southern Greece. His grandfather, Alexander I , participated in the olympic games, where only Greeks were allowed to participate. There are also many instances where he referred to himself as Greek. He famously said: ""Ευχαριστώ τοις Θεοίς ότι εγεννήθην Έλλην"" (I thank the gods for being born Greek). He said that he was Greek many times, and it was for Greece that he fought and sought revenge against the Persians who had previously harmed them. Moreover, building a huge statue of a hero who doeasn't belong to you, doesn't give you more claim to him. Go find another history to steal, you uneducated fuck."
5839,UgxnQikO00VW4A1OSzR4AaABAg.8vKkx0XcF2S8vUsqYYSMuv,UgxnQikO00VW4A1OSzR4AaABAg,"@Violator  look you are boring with your story, Alexander of Macedonia, not of Greece, not of elada, not of ellas, not of greky.... Macedonia has always Kings and royalties, you, filozofers, actors, musicians, story tellers, democracy, he kills lot of Athenians, he occupied Athens, they hate him. Suddenly he is your national hero???  You only now put on ridicules small monument of him. Pathetic . Only because Republic of Macedonia has 10 times bigger monument you cried in the European parliament to block them. You behaving like tonnage girls or better say sissys. Get real, try to act like real man!!!! ""city state "" ?????? Macedonia was a Kingdom for thousands of years!!!!!"

5841,UgxnQikO00VW4A1OSzR4AaABAg.8vKkx0XcF2S8vU3PkQ1xd1,UgxnQikO00VW4A1OSzR4AaABAg,"@Violator  yes I agree, my point was in that time Sicily was under Macedonian rules. Rome was busy fighting Cartage (remember Hanibal, and his father early) Rome look like 3 world country?  So Alexander has not really economic reason to get involved with Rome. Letter after his death their was 100 years war. The story about Rome now is born in the 15/16 sentury by Vatican, so Greece and Rome become favorite country to create a story about history (fake history) even the calendar and the number of senturis are not correct."

5912,UgyAqSMov0w6SwYBv5d4AaABAg,YbS6LMF5Ed0,Rome basically usurped The Etruscans & appropriated / assimilated their culture & Greek culture. Gladiatorial games were originally Etruscan funerary rites if memory serves...Can't help but see similarities to certain Old Testament stories. I love how certain themes turn up in every culture :)Rhea wasn't buried alive? That was supposedly  the punishment for any Vestal Virgin who broke her vow of chastity wasn't it?Great video- really interesting.

5931,UgyN6ZVg5bAqp7_GzYd4AaABAg,YbS6LMF5Ed0,Considering how many kings and religious leaders that have been murdered for government's political agendas. I would have to say murder. It's much easier to kill a person off that stands in the way of new ideologies and use them as a martyr into a new form of society. Look how Constantine used Jesus Christ and Christianity as his pedestal to progress the Roman agenda. I hate Rome. I hate all greedy European societies. They destroyed and wasted all of their own natural resources and set out to do the same to the rest of the world.

Before Greece had any established Greek cities Google Greek Dark Ages(not the same as europea dark ages). They were in Libya learning how to build and start a civilization. The greeks themselves said it. ""Plato studied in Egypt for 13 years under the Horite priest Sechnuphis. ...

In short, the head of Purusha became the Brahmin, his arms the Kshatriya, his thighs the Vaishya, and his feet the Shudra, hence the four primary castes (or varnas) in Ancient Indian society (starting from the early Vedic age to India before 1947, though it became way more complicated by then). Though intimately linked to religion, the caste system was more of a socio-cultural construct than a religious one."

Let me mention that Aeneas was Aphrodites child and he was about to die in Troy by the Greeks at the Trojan war but Greeks let him carry his father and leave Troy for his respect! He went to Kyme or Latio of Italy and his son Askanios created Alba Longa. Askanios sons was Remus and Romulus but also the traditions of these childs follow the same Greek traditions and myths way :)

Their traditional gods were a pale imitation of Greek mythology, mere colourless ghosts silently accepted for the benefit of social convention. In no way were those gods allowed to interfere with ""real"" life. When consulted, they had to give oracles through the medium of their priests, but they were never supposed to confer moral laws upon men or to direct their actions. The Roman Empire’s sole goal in its long existence was to expand and flourish at the expense of the countless nations they invaded, nevertheless, they did have a refined intellectual and aesthetic taste despite their somewhat purely materialistic outlook on life. It’s still so crazy to me how different the Romans were from the Greeks when it came to theological beliefs, although sadly this fact gets overlooked by many people these days whenever the Roman Empire or the Greeks are brought up during history lessons."

6166,UgzKEIQyI0RaCVMPX_N4AaABAg,iPAwnvyN6xw,"Rome. The most celebrated city in the world at the time of Christ. It is said to have been founded B.C. 753. When the New Testament was written, Rome was enriched and adorned with the spoils of the world, and contained a population estimated at 1,200,000, of which the half were slaves, and including representatives of nearly every nation then known. It was distinguished for its wealth and luxury and profligacy. The empire of which it was the capital had then reached its greatest prosperity.On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem ""strangers from Rome,"" who doubtless carried with them back to Rome tidings of that great day, and were instrumental in founding the church there. Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years (Acts 28:30, 31) ""in his own hired house."" While here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus (Acts 27:2), Timothy (Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:1), Tychicus (Eph. 6: 21), Epaphroditus (Phil. 4:18), and John Mark (Col. 4:10). (See [538]PAUL.)Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called ""catacombs,"" which were used from about the time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of worship and burial. About four thousand inscriptions have been found in the catacombs. These give an interesting insight into the history of the church at Rome down to the time of Constantine."

The Hellenic pantheon was only adopted gradually over time in a piecemeal fashion. Emphasis always remained on Demeter, who had far less of a ""directed personality"" than Ceres, and Saturn, who, despite the association Kronos, was not a syncretic addition, but an autocthonic aboriginal development with its own attributes and origin myth.This video is why you should never try to learn history from YouTube unless you enjoy looking like a moron and being publicly mocked."

All of them rapresent some common concept. Like nature, love, war, commerce and sea travel. Surely all of them have the same indo-european cultural origin"" the fact that there are greek gods that are correspective of italic ones doesn't mean they were copied. Portunud is one of the anciest god of the italic tribes and so was tellus, but its' only natural that ancient people had a god of earth like gaia. Mamers was the first god of the oscan tribes and predates the arrival of the greeks as he wasn't exactly the god of war but the god of youth and the defensor of the land. Then cloacina is not aphrodites as she was the goddes of sewers, so no correlation and Bona dea was worshipped in umbria so not in magna graecia and was the goddes of water springs. Then again i've only wrote some of the italic gods but there are a lot more of them and they were all equally worshipped because italic tribes were very utilitaristic and believed in the pax deorum so even the god that protected cows were keep in high consideration. I'll list some other latin/oscan gods : Caligine, Carmenta, Concordia, Conso, Cura, Dis pater, Epona, Feronia, Febris, Flora, Fontus, Fortuna, Furrina, Giuturna, Iuventas, Mefite, Opi, Ore , Pale, Pax, Robigus, Rumina, Terminus, Tiberino, Vaticano, Sterculo, Vesta, Anna perenna, Aesculano, Abbundantia.

6514,UgwmBNaUjgxnZKIXmoR4AaABAg.8cHoIA02ePj9KXBFlscs6F,UgwmBNaUjgxnZKIXmoR4AaABAg,"@aquila Roman mythology is so heavily influenced by Greek mythology that it hurts me whenever people say Greek and Roman mythology. First, the Ancient Greeks colonized the whole Mediterranean in the Archaic age (around 8th century B.C.) and they even had a special name for the colonies in the Italian peninsula: Megali Hellas (known as Magna Grecia). I doubt Rome was even founded by the time Greeks settled in southern Italy.It's not only the mythology, it's even the Latin language. It was heavily based on Ancient Greek. Of course, Ancient Greek was also inspired by the Phoenician language, but they didn't have vowels, which Greeks invented.The Roman constitution of the Roman Republic. If you look at the Spartan Constitution (made by Lycourgus around 9th century B.C.), you will see similarities in the offices that wielded most of the political power (2 Consuls - 2 kings, Senate - Gerousia, Tribunes - Ephors, etc.), while you can similarities of the roman assemblies to the meetings of both Sparta and Athens.Finally, about that list you mentioned, I have to say the following.Pomona - no counterpartVerdumno - no counterpart (same story with Pomona)Portunus - MelicertesBellona - EnyoJanus - no counterpartKerres (I presume you mean Ceres) - DemetraAio Locutio - no counterpartBona dea - Possibly a version of Demetra, but nevertheless her worship was copied by Magna Grecia, who were Greek settlers in the Archaic AgeCloacina - AphroditeQuirinus - An epithet of Janus or Hercules, or another version of RomulusTellus - GaiaLupercus - PanSalus - HygeiaMamers - AresAnd I think that all these gods you listed combined (barring Janus) were less important to the average Roman citizen than any of the Roman major god mentioned in the video, that originate from Greek Mythology."

If you actually knew anything about European people you would realize that while Greeks, Italians, Germans, Celts are all of the same race they are Ethnically different. Romans in their current form have existed in Europe for more than 5,500 years. The same as all other Europeans. Before this time all Europeans had the typical Mediterranean appearance and what changed this (mainly in the north) were the invasions of the aryans.. Aryans were a people originally from the same place the other Europeans were from so it was just a rejoining back to their own people.. the reason for the difference in appearance was the fact that these people were seperated from each other in different environments for about 25,000 years."

Another thing, the good old orcs come from orcus and later italian stories on it/similar monsters (they were so popular that people started calling even monsters slightly similar to orcs 'orcs', like grendel in bewoulf, orcus is more similar to the 'warcraft variant but with black boar-like fur, and to the ogres of lotr)"

I should point out that initial aristocracy spoke greek and Etruscan and not latin. But that wasn't uncommon), Romans slowly turned away from Greece as they went further north and south of Italy, and seeing how culture departed away from their own and how they were more latin than anything. By the time of the punic wars, Rome was fully Latin and greek became insignificant in bureaucracy, Greek would come back in popularity after the conquest of Greece for foreign easter bureaucracy (as usual for the Romans). Sulla would bring the border of Italy up to Rome, caesar as consul up to Florentia and tyrrean islands, and finally Augustus up to Switzerland (Helvetia) and Dalmatia (more changes would be made in the future). The reason why romans initially saw themselves as Greek is because they came to hate the Etruscans, but as the unification of Italy came about the Romans became more distant from the Greeks and more Italian as the differences between Romans and other Italics became noticeably lesser than the actual Hellenistic greeks (Rome initial contact with hellenist kingdoms was the other Italian colonies. The difference wasn't noticeable yet)."
6640,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg.8bykKAJIAwL8gXFWLfzIyP,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg,"You know about the Tyrrhenians? Pelasgians? And secondly, I am referring to mythology for an ancient commemoration when the Aegean was still land and at this moment we are talking there are many buried cities in the water. Greek culture is the final result, the final product of all these cultures that sprang into the Aegean earth. Dionysios the Alikarnasses (A ""Introduction) characterizes the Etruscan Greeks, who, along with the Lycians and other Pelasgians, settled in Italy. He himself, like Diodorus Sikeliotis, Thucydides and Strabo, asserts that the Tyrrhenians (Etruscans) were the ancient Greeks of the Tyrsians, who from the Tursa of Asia Minor and other parts of the Aegean area fell to Italy along with other Pelasgians.I do not say that, the ancient writers say. This. Good luck."
6641,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg.8bykKAJIAwL8e1J9d8n3Se,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg,"Well, I disagree. The Early Italian Civilizations developed around the same time as the Greeks. The Greeks began building colonies in Italy around the same time the Etrsucans, Ligurians, Early Venetians, Messapians, Oscans, Umbrians and Early Sicilians inhabited Italy. The fact that they mentioned the Trojans migrating to Italy was just mythology, that was written after the formation of the Roman Empire, and the Punic Wars. Also, after looking at a map circa 500-400 BC, you will see that the northernmost Greek settlement in Italy was around Naples. The Romans most likely guessed their ancestry in the book (Forgot what it was called), as the Romans a century or two before destroyed almost all of the Etrsucan scriptures, and in turn forgot their true ancestors. I'm not trying to start an argument, but I simply disagree with you."

6645,UgzfR2xF_ZGrZ7mL1Ux4AaABAg.8byHfJT9q-z8bzbKDjl3v4,UgzfR2xF_ZGrZ7mL1Ux4AaABAg,"Mithras was not originally a Roman god. He is an eastern God (on of the so-called New gods) that the Romans imported during the Empire age and adopted as their own (see also Sol Invictus, Gea Mater Deorum). Having said that, all the classic gods themselves are also adopted from the Greeks or at least adapted, so the only truly ""Roman"" gods out there would be the early Latin/Italic deities. Most of these were later abandoned but the Romans did keep Ianus and Quirinus, for some time at least"

6653,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg.8by-0GTS1IA8f1fHMIV0q2,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg,"The Underworld is called Erebus/Erebos or sometimes Hades. The Greek God of the Underworld is Hades and the Roman one is Pluto, but the Romans focused more on him as the god of wealth. Orcus, on the other hand, is the God of Broken Vows who guards the River Styx and ensures no one breaks a vow. Of course, the etymology of the word Pluto may come from Greek but he is 100% a Roman God. Trust me, for about 3 years I've been studying the Graeco-Roman pantheons. I know what I'm saying."

6656,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg.8by-0GTS1IA8byneyrtWch,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg,"You both made me research it again. From what I found, Hades is the most ancient name for the Greek god, with Pluto - Pluton to be exact - being added later. Since then ""Hades"" mostly described the kingdom of the Underworld, but was still used as the name of the god.The same however goes with ""Orcus"". It was both the name of the place and the god. And the reason I mentioned it in my first comment is because no one who is intrested in Greco-Roman mythology seems to know it.So maybe, just like Apollo, Pluto's name could have been borrowed with a Latin twist (Apollon-> Apollo  // Pluton->  Pluto). I ""insist"" on the name Pluton being of Greek origin because it appears to have an etymological relation with Plutos (Latinised Plutus), the Greek god of wealth. The etymology itself must be referring to the ground, as both of them were chthonic deities, the first one ruling and living in the Underworld and the second one offering the treasures of the ground."
6657,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg.8by-0GTS1IA8by_EVzqOzB,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg,Pluto is the Roman name for the god. If you are talking Greek mythology Hades is both the god and the place

6662,UgzADAeZKV2TuV4mUEl4AaABAg,iPAwnvyN6xw,"Overall, this is a really awesome video and condenses a lot of the mythos down into a manageable piece - a very rare thing when doing so from the Roman perspective! I will give one note though, Uranus and Gaia are only the Greek names for the pair of deities you display in the grandparent generation. However, to the Romans they were known as Caelus and Terra or Tellus Mater respectively and were classed as Primordial Deities rather than Titans along with multiple others of the generation or generations  before the Titans - the parentage and familial lines of these beings gets pretty fuzzy in comparison to that of the later ones in both the Roman and Greek variations. Other than that, very well done!!"

Also Norse Myths are better recorded, since Norse Believes lasted longer than Germanic Ones there were manuscripts of Norse Myths that survived into the modern era (granted you can kinda tell with some sources that the authors were recently converted Christians who were trying to make their old believes coincide with their new believes, for example there’s a version of Ragnorok where the only survivors are one God, a man, a woman, and a Garden)"

Why? Because Latin, Etruscans and Greeks share the same Indo-European roots. Etruscans and Romans didn't copy anything.

Jupiter and Mars, as many other Roman Gods didn't come from Greece, they just matched later Greek Gods"

However most Roman gods were already around prior to the contact with the Greeks. The idea that Romans ""ripped off"" Greek religion is a bit of a popular misconception.Most Roman deities were actually adapted from the Etruscans or neighbouring Italian tribes. The gods and religion of early Iron Age Italy likely shared a common ancestor with those of the Greeks (likely from a Proto-Indo-European people ancestral to both the Greeks and Italians from before they diverged and settled into their respective landmasses), hence the similarities.The Romans eventually copied the Greek myths and the Greek ""family tree of the gods"" and retroactively applied them to their own equivalents of those gods. Though that said those equivalents weren't always 100% exactly and the Romans didn't necessarily copy Greek elements if they weren't ""compatible"".The Romans also eventually imported foreign gods that they had no equivalent of and just added them to their existing Pantheon, such as Isis or Cybele, some of which became more popular among the Romans than most of their 'native' gods."

The Latins, Faliscans and various Sabellics do share a reasonably close common prehistoric ancestor with the Greeks, as do the Celts but slightly more distantly.The Etruscans, being surrounded by Indo-Europeans on all sides, did undergo their own process of assimilating and adapting elements from Indo-European religion, making things even more complicated.Though, yes, some originally non-Indo-European elements likely bled through into Roman religion through the Etruscans."

7012,UgzJGAgld94HCXFPuCl4AaABAg,l-P8t33xHuM," emoji_Italy FIRST ROMAN SETTLEMENTSThe oldest settlements of what will later become Rome date back to very remote times, even to Neanderthal man. The oldest seems to be in the Valchetta area, with human remains from 65,000 years ago, another in via di Torre Spaccata from 60,000 years ago.We move on to the Iron Age with the arrival of the Latins of Indo-European descent, therefore not indigenous, first a Latin-Faliscan group and then an Umbrian-Sabello group. Those same Latins who met Aeneas, according to tradition, when, fleeing from Troy, he landed in Lazio. Rome was formed with the fusion of many different people, because where different civilizations converge there is an exchange that amplifies knowledge.No civilization can boast a mass of people and races like Rome, a point of connection between the West and the East, also because it stretches out both on the river and on the sea. In ancient times the ground was covered with forests and dangerous for wild beasts, coast-to-coast navigation, or by river, was the least dangerous way to move.The Falisci occupied the Tiber valley, between the Cimini mountains and the Sabatini mountains, while the Latins occupied the Latium vetus, the ancient Lazio, which ran from the right bank of the Tiber to the Alban Hills, bordering the Etruscans north of the Tiber. The Volsci, and in part the Ernici, instead occupied the south of Lazio; the Aurunci, and a little the Rutuli, the Lazio Campana coast; the Sabines the Apennine area to the north, the Equi to the east. It is probable that the Hellespontus in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey) contributed to the union of cultures, when around 1100 BC, Troy fell and the survivors took refuge in Lazio.Excavations at the Foro Boario have uncovered some Greek pottery from the 8th century BC which already showed commercial relations with the Hellenic colonies at the time.The Palatine huts, of which there are numerous traces, had a shape between the rectangular and the elliptical, in all similar to those of the hut urns of the same period, found in the archaic burial ground of the Forum, which were used to contain the ashes of the deceased and they imitated the house where he had lived.The large holes along the edge and in the center were used to house the support poles of the roof, while smaller holes, on both sides of the doorway, had to support a particular and light cover in front of the door itself.The traces of the hearth were very clear next to the central hole.Their dating is from the 8th century BC, that is, fully corresponding to the date of the foundation of Rome, moreover, the remains of a palace have recently been found.The prehistoric tombs next to the foundations of the disappeared Arch of Augustus, in the Roman Forum, a culture similar to the proto-Villanovan one, with unadorned vases, probably from the 1st millennium BC, in the Bronze Age, testify to these settlements. A necropolis necessarily derives from a village of permanent dwellings.Another testimony is the necropolis next to the temple of Antoninus Pius and Faustina with prehistoric burials, also in the Roman Forum, next to villages of huts, ranging from the 9th to the 8th century. BC, then reserved only for children's tombs until the 7th century BCThe ancient inhabitants of Rome inhumed, unlike the later Romans who mainly incinated the dead. Burial is characteristic of matriarchal or matriarchal societies, while cremation is patriarchal and nomadic. Which means that the ancestors of Rome were matriarchal, in fact returning the body to the earth presupposes a devotion to Mother Nature or Earth.Still finds from the Bronze Age in the area of ​​Sant'Omobono, at the church of Sant'Omobono, at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, with two temples, of the Dea Fortuna and of the Mater Matuta, from the sixth century. BC, two primordial Goddesses worshiped as Mothers of the pantheon, in short, Great Mothers of the Gods.The two twin temples were built on the area already occupied by protohistoric huts and only one has been excavated because the second is under the church. The Goddess Fortuna is the Greek Ananke, against whom, as Homer says, the Gods can do nothing, or the Roman Fatum, the one who guides the fortunes. It is no coincidence that in Palestrina there was the temple, Cicero talks about it, of Fortuna Primigenia, in whose temple lots were cast, that is, the dice to predict the future.In the center of Rome almost all the churches are built on pagan temples, to make people forget the old gods and because the people there used to go there. In addition, it was possible to take advantage of the marbles and columns. The famous Cosmatesque pavements so frequent in Roman churches are nothing more than Roman marbles that have been broken up and reassembled according to a design, and many of the columns are ancient Roman. To get an idea just visit the Pantheon where the gigantic Roman marbles are preserved intact.It seems that the temple of Fortuna dates back to Servius Tullius, and sacred prostitution, or Ierodulia, was practiced there, which was used throughout the Mediterranean and in all ancient civilizations, especially as a female priesthood (the male one is rarer). The sanctuaries were abandoned in the 4th century BC, with the end of the Etruscan monarchy."

Both Romulus and Remus are the founder of rome but romulus is the first ruler of roma because remus was killed by his brother during dispute on how to interpret the sign from god. The twin brothers agreed to built a city in the seven hill of tiber river but one prefer on alvantine hill the other prefer on palpatine hill. They actually try to peacefully negotiate their differences by asking the god favour. However, both claimed the sign of god favour which lead to violence so remus did not have time to build different city and cross the wall of romulus city.  Remus was killed during the sign of god dispute. Another important thing that the video fail to mention that sabine women convince romulus and king of sabine to joint rule their combined city in peace. King of Sabine was much older than romulus, he died 5 years later leaving romulus as the sole ruler of the combined city  emoji_face_without_mouth "

El año 1000 A.C. es muy anterior (etapa del bronce itálico y del hierro aprox.), inclusive antes del mito de Rómulo y Remo que es en el 753 A.C., lo cual según historiadores no es posible porque  en esos momentos solo se trataba de aldeas que no estaban unificadas, menos puede ser en el año 1000 A.C.

7135,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,LdUWr6TGj6A,"Muy instructivo. Solamente un pero, no entiendo cómo al comienzo del video se sugieren 2700 años para la historia de Roma, que en realidad son unos 1000 años, a partir del 510ac. O si se quiere ampliar antes de la república, 200 años más. Civilizaciones anteriores como la egipcia si tienen más de 3000 años de historia. Un saludo"
7136,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8MErPlpZgOm,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"@Xabi Pombo Hasta lo que se sabe en lo que hoy se conoce como Roma hay una población fija desde el 1100 a.C. si no recuerdo mal y es exactamente a lo que me refería, la historia de Roma empezó mucho antes que el imperio, república e incluso monarquía al igual que Egipto, la historia no se limita a los imperios, en el 340 a.C. Roma ya era una ciudad con casi mil años de historia, si no más, puede que en un futuro se encuentren evidencias más antiguas. Aún así si contamos los años de reinados, imperios o similares (sin contar las épocas en la que la organización social era tribal) puede que Roma supere a Egipto, no estoy seguro pero andan emparejados y en mi opinión los egipcios tienen algo más de mérito ya que innovaron antes que casi cualquier otra cultura, de hecho Roma no sería lo que fue sin las civilizaciones de las que aprendió."
7137,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8MEUvQLb3qe,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"En ningún caso he hablado de imperios, solo quería reflejar que los orígenes de Egipto se remontan al 3100 ac, sin contar el predinástico, y como bien dices hasta el 340 ac aprox nos dan unos 2800 años de historia antes de que Roma ni siquiera existiese. Desde entonces solo han pasado menos de 2400 años hasta nuestros días. No salen las cuentas, por eso quería matizar. De hecho tanto la cultura romana como la griega y muchas otras de la antigüedad beben directamente de la Egipcia. Un saludo"
7138,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8LJ5UojMu75,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"+Xabi Pompo Se han encontrado evidencias arquitectónicas en Roma datadas en el año 1100 a.c. es decir que la fundación mitológica tiene muy poco o nada que ver con la realidad. Cuando se habla de la historia de Roma solo hace referencia a eso, su historia (en la cual se incluyen todo, idioma, tecnología, religión, medicina etc etc) otra cosa es el tiempo cronológico de la monarquía, república o imperio, pero la historia abarca mucho más, de hecho nosotros somos descendientes de los romanos, las leyes, cultura, costumbres... podría decirse que la historia romana continúa, casi todo nos lo legaron los romanos, por eso supongo que se diga que la historia de Roma tiene 2700 años, si no más. En cuanto a Egipto si se habla del imperio estrictamente egipcio, realmente el imperio egipcio dominado por egipcios es hasta el año 340 a.c. de ahí en adelante no se puede considerar imperio egipcio ya que pasó a ser parte del imperio persa, hasta la llegada de Alejandro III de Macedonia y pasó a ser parte del imperio macedonio hasta la caída de estos y ser reemplazados por los romanos, en resumidas cuentas el imperio egipcio no es tan longevo como la gente cree, la historia egipcia al igual que la romana si es más amplia, pero no ha legado tanto como los romanos, sobre todo en temas legislativos, logísticos, militares, tecnológicos, arquitectónicos... al menos para la cultura occidental, eso si, Egipto fue una gran civilización de la cual sus sucesores aprendieron mucho."
