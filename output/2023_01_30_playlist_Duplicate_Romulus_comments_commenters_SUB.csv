23,UgiNGQ-bS7-KcngCoAEC,7xP_TLiswp8,I would definitely call myself and amateur historian. but I love rome learning new things watching videos like this one. I recall hearing a myth that Romulus disappeared after a lighting strike.

25,UghyeE4SPfUCQHgCoAEC,7xP_TLiswp8,talking about the fall if the Roman empire only the western roman empire fell the eastern roman empire which controlled all of Greece and nowdays turkey lived on for another thousand years the eastern roman emperor want to become independent from Rome so thus became the byzantine empire that fell after the ottam turks attacked constanaople
26,Ugj-BOOyqSkZZHgCoAEC,7xP_TLiswp8,"*Who were Romulus and Remus? Aside from that, good video!"

33,UgjOE82MAvnw_XgCoAEC,7xP_TLiswp8,So is Romulus killing Remus like a metaphor for the Roman overthrow of the Etruscan king?
34,Ughb-aqrS4wnX3gCoAEC,7xP_TLiswp8,"I like the idea of the ship that was coming from troy, although it seems unlikely it would be very interesting. I do believe that the two brothers did existed but I don't think they had  anything to do with royalty"

38,UggULNxKwPZyY3gCoAEC.8LIrTwWj0Nb8fF3HMrmtNx,UggULNxKwPZyY3gCoAEC,No u nub
39,UgjtGaJx3ZcZxHgCoAEC,7xP_TLiswp8,The version I know of has Romulus kill his brother over a disagreement over what to call their new city. Hence Rome. Not sure what the city would have been called had Remus won. Remi maybe?
40,UgjtGaJx3ZcZxHgCoAEC.8LIlodzeDw-8LIrZNkUUZw,UgjtGaJx3ZcZxHgCoAEC,"The remian empire, hhmmm not bad"
41,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,7xP_TLiswp8,"As someone studying history in a university in Norway, i think this was a good short explanation.The Etruscans influence on Rome was huge. From them, the early Romans learned how to drain swamps, more advanced city planning, and more.However, as the Romans overthrew the last (and according to some sources; opressive) Etruscan king, they formed a republic to make sure that no man alone would rule Rome again.And they were successful, until Sulla."
42,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCg64qGxPx,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@***** please don't ever speak again. Almost all of the Greek city states hated eachother, and so it is expected for them to call the Macedonians not Greeks. However, that doesn't make them not Greek. They are still just as Greek as all the other Greeks. And don't use the argument of democracy, because Sparta was also not democratic. And it doesn't matter if they viewed them as barbarians, they are just as civilized as all of the other Greeks. Different people hate eachother, simple. Are north and South Korea then also different cultures? They are by your logic, since they don't both have democratic values, they are viewed as pretty much barbarians (not literally) by the eachother, and they didn't use the same systems as eachother."
43,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCX8pM-Q3f,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@***** it is not false, I am saying that they were both Latin, and so both had a common beginning. It's like comparing Macedonia and Sparta, not that different."
44,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCKavA39Vn,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,@Tarek E How is my logic false?
45,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCJg827RvQ,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@Tarek EYeah, that is one of the commonly thought ""myths"", the roman believed that themselves. New evidence however gives some more ground behind the myth, making it a theory. I shall not claim to know what is, or is not, true in this case."
46,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCGR_URVQI,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"+InsertUsername apparently, the Greeks write that the Romans were trojans who had escaped troy. so that makes their origins greek, ad,  as far as I know, the trojans were Greeks."
47,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCGQjm4Mre,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"+InsertUsername apparently, the Greeks write that the Romans were trojans who had escaped troy. so that makes their origins greek, ad,  as far as I know, the trojans were Greeks."
48,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCEH2Ntmz2,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@Tarek EYes, but i have always heard that they were considered ""foreign"" or opressive. Put there to keep the romans under their controll, basicly imperialistic motives. And that this lead to the strong disgust romans shared for even the thought of having a king, when they became a republic. This can also be seen as to why Caesar was unable to take the title ""king"", even though ""dictator"" was aceptable.Anyway, i find this topic very interesting!"
49,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCAqyvJLPS,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,@InsertUsername there were even Etruscan kings in Rome.
50,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCAntVap5f,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,@InsertUsername basically though they are both Latin.
51,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OCAis7Bkan,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,@InsertUsername would appreciate it :)
52,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OC3mqpNm5H,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@Tarek EYes, the difference is miniscule, but i still think that it is important to recognize that they are different people, if nothing else, because they saw themselves as different. I shall admit that it is a long time since i last looked into this, but i am going to se a consultor regarding my bachelor task tomorrow. He is UIO`s (the university where i study) foremost expert on romans and the greeks. I plan to take this topic upp with him, and I can post what he replies if you will."
53,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OC-tHCfxS_,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@InsertUsername but that is my point. The difference is as negligible as that, not to the point of Romans vs Gauls or Romans vs Carthaginians..."
54,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OByJDqhHtN,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@Tarek EThe romans and etruscan were different. They had different cultures (the romans took a lot from the etruscan people) and, most importantly, they saw themselves as different people. Calling them the same people is like arguing that Norwegians, Sweedish, Danish and German people ar all the same. Sure, the same type of people, but they do not see themselves as the same people."
55,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OBPwUsBBUH,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@***** but ok, think what you will."
56,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OBPtN9t7b4,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@***** sorry, autocorrect failed me. Meant to say Samnites."
57,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OAX5Xcv4po,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@Tarek E yet the etruscan language is complettely oknown to us, they were the only culture in the area to build necropolis for the dead (sort of cities for the dead) which latins and greeks did not) the etruscans were a confederation of city states unlike the tribes of latium. the Samaritans are from palestine so maybe the Sabine's? which, yes they are latin but etruscans and romans are very different"
58,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OAQUnzqIk2,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@***** that's where you are wrong. Etruscans are also Latin, just like Samaritans are also Latin. These peoples have almost the exact same culture as the Romans, they just had different countries."
59,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OAI7HX4OZ7,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,@Tarek E latins and etruscan are different
60,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8OAB-UczRAI,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"InsertUsername you can't really make a real distinction between Rome and the Etruscans. The Romans and the Etruscans were the same as the Romans, they were just different in state. In the end tho, they all had Greek influence."
61,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8LKvfSTBOcD,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,"@The New CaesarWell of course the Greeks influenced them, no doubt. The culture and society of Rome shared many similarities with citystates, and the Romans, at one point, even thought off their city as a form of greek city state. The republik was also formed after the democratic Greek ideal."
62,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC.8LIOo1UhbkO8LKPR9dSJlo,UghaHz7FGCW9q3gCoAEC,InsertUsername I believe Greeks influenced Rome as well. I remember a book while back that the romans first used the phalanx but then adopted the maniple system.

And they all word it exactly the same way?The opposite would happen, everyone with access to the books would call him out for lying because the books didn’t have anyone named “Cain” or “Abel” in them.Moreover the Jews had every reason to despise him, and the Christians were still seen as enemies of the Roman Republic, so they wouldn’t like him either, and the Samaritans didn’t speak with Jews entirely."

I think you need to face the fact that it does not exist in older art, writing , or has an archeological basis. Romulus and Remus is probably an invention too considering a wall of Rome was discovered and is about 200 years older than the founding story.The jubilees is in a separate collection of the ""dead sea scrolls"".  Which some have combined into representing the same collection. The dating of that fragment is 1st ad still. If you read On Imitation, it becomes very clear what the Romans were doing at the time with literature."

And Abel was a keeper of flocks, but Cain wa]s a tiller of the ground. And in the course of time C[ain] brought an offering to the Lord [*from the fruit of the ground.]  4. And Abel also brought of the first[*lings of his flock and their fat portions. And]So the text is present but the scroll is heavily damaged, the brackets represent missing or unreadable text.Also Josephus in the 1st century wrote:“Adam and Eve had two sons: the elder of them was named Cain; which name, when it is interpreted, signifies a Possession. The younger was Abel; which signifies Sorrow. They had also daughters...”and“Whence it was that Cain was very angry that Abel was preferred by God before him, and he slew his Brother, and hid his dead body: thinking to escape discovery.”How was Josephus quoting this story before it existed? That makes no sense at all. Beyond this Josephus tells us he’s relating the story from the Torah, and the Septuagint. If it wasn’t present in these documents how could he make this claim and be taken seriously?"

There are also no contemporary sources for Romulus and Remus. But there are contemporary sources for the writers who described them both.Josephus describes Cain and Abel being in the book of Genesis in the 1st Century, and contemporary sources describe Josephus in the first century.He also describes the Septuagint being translated in the 3rd century BC, and the Old Testament being much older than that.If Dionysius can be confirmed via contemporary sources, so can the Septuagint and the New Testament, of which we have numerous first and second century sources that it existed prior to the Vaticanus, as well as hundreds of manuscript fragments that confirm that.In fact most scholars attribute the Cain and Abel story to the Jahwist source, and date it during the 6th century BC. This was a long time before Dionysius lived.Actually I think you may be wrong about Cain and Abel not appearing in the Dead Sea Scrolls, it appears the narrative is somewhat fragmentary, but it IS present."

Two paragraphs is too long for you to read?I’ll keep it simple: Show me a single Dionysus manuscript that predates the Vaticanus.The only reason for you to accept a BC composition date for Dionysius WITHOUT manuscript evidence, while at the same time denying a BC composition of the septuagint BECAUSE of a lack of manuscript evidence is pure bias.Apply the same standard to both works.

349,UgyG22pJLZkS0R23unl4AaABAg.91ZR7UINGVc91bkBEOAoDo,UgyG22pJLZkS0R23unl4AaABAg,"Michael PierceYou said to find one manuscript that old, I named on for you.But that’s not the point, the Septuagint is a Greek translation of a Hebrew-Aramaic document that pre-existed it in the 3rd century BC, and there is zero Textual-Critical evidence that the Cain and Abel story was a later interpolation.Moreover, the Hebrew and the Samaritan texts we have also have the Cain and Abel story, it would be ridiculous for the same story to be backwards interpolated into these languages too, especially since the Jews, Samaritans, and Christians all hated each other. Also the Cain and Abel Greek story shows textual evidence of having been a translation from a Semitic language originally, which argues strongly against it being a Greek invention entirely.But beyond ALL of that, the manuscript witnesses we have of the Septuagint version of the Cain and Abel story are actually older than the manuscript evidence of the Romulus and Remus story, and the primary reason we have the Romulus and Remus story is because Christians preserved the writings of the people like Pliny and Dionysius into the Middle Ages.The Sainaticus and Vaticanus May be from 300 ad. and be the oldest complete manuscripts, but we have an umpteen number of manuscripts and fragments from centuries before, which they largely agree with. No one argues for a 300ad composition date for the old and new testaments."

353,UgyG22pJLZkS0R23unl4AaABAg.91ZR7UINGVc91bZmdUMgUI,UgyG22pJLZkS0R23unl4AaABAg,"Michael Pierce Michael PiercePatently false. The Greek Septuagint is dated to the 3rd century BC and contains Cain and Abel, this date for the Septuagint is corroborated by a number of witnesses including Josephus in the 1st century.Moreover, Dionysius of Halicarnassus was born in the first century BC, not the third. Meaning he lived 200 years after the accepted date of the Septuagint. And the oldest Dionysius manuscript we possess is from the 10th century AD, 1000 years after he lived.The earliest manuscript of the Septuagint by comparison is from the 1st or 2nd century BC, a full 1200 years earlier.But even BEYOND that argument, are you really suggesting that one of these barely related stories has to be derivative from the other? As if no royalty ever has killed his brother before? Cain’s fratricide isn’t even related to the building of his city, the two events are far apart in time and Abel was not an aggressor against Cain. These stories barely relate."

Where is the 7 centuries you’re talking about? What’s the earliest primary source for Romulus and Remus?Also, what exactly are the similarities? Cain and Abel were brothers. They were not twins, they were not abandoned, they were not the children of a Virgin or of adultery of any kind, they did not kill a King, they were not bandits.Is the only similarity that they are brothers, and that Cain founded a city after killing Abel? Is fratricide truly that rare in ancient history that one of these stories has to be related to the other?There’s hardly a historical royal family history that does not include fratricide."

Solamente un pero, no entiendo cómo al comienzo del video se sugieren 2700 años para la historia de Roma, que en realidad son unos 1000 años, a partir del 510ac. O si se quiere ampliar antes de la república, 200 años más. Civilizaciones anteriores como la egipcia si tienen más de 3000 años de historia. Un saludo"
454,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8MErPlpZgOm,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"@Xabi Pombo Hasta lo que se sabe en lo que hoy se conoce como Roma hay una población fija desde el 1100 a.C. si no recuerdo mal y es exactamente a lo que me refería, la historia de Roma empezó mucho antes que el imperio, república e incluso monarquía al igual que Egipto, la historia no se limita a los imperios, en el 340 a.C. Roma ya era una ciudad con casi mil años de historia, si no más, puede que en un futuro se encuentren evidencias más antiguas. Aún así si contamos los años de reinados, imperios o similares (sin contar las épocas en la que la organización social era tribal) puede que Roma supere a Egipto, no estoy seguro pero andan emparejados y en mi opinión los egipcios tienen algo más de mérito ya que innovaron antes que casi cualquier otra cultura, de hecho Roma no sería lo que fue sin las civilizaciones de las que aprendió."
455,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8MEUvQLb3qe,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"En ningún caso he hablado de imperios, solo quería reflejar que los orígenes de Egipto se remontan al 3100 ac, sin contar el predinástico, y como bien dices hasta el 340 ac aprox nos dan unos 2800 años de historia antes de que Roma ni siquiera existiese. Desde entonces solo han pasado menos de 2400 años hasta nuestros días. No salen las cuentas, por eso quería matizar. De hecho tanto la cultura romana como la griega y muchas otras de la antigüedad beben directamente de la Egipcia. Un saludo"
456,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC.875q7aFLCsJ8LJ5UojMu75,Ugjgvs4xIfZiKXgCoAEC,"+Xabi Pompo Se han encontrado evidencias arquitectónicas en Roma datadas en el año 1100 a.c. es decir que la fundación mitológica tiene muy poco o nada que ver con la realidad. Cuando se habla de la historia de Roma solo hace referencia a eso, su historia (en la cual se incluyen todo, idioma, tecnología, religión, medicina etc etc) otra cosa es el tiempo cronológico de la monarquía, república o imperio, pero la historia abarca mucho más, de hecho nosotros somos descendientes de los romanos, las leyes, cultura, costumbres... podría decirse que la historia romana continúa, casi todo nos lo legaron los romanos, por eso supongo que se diga que la historia de Roma tiene 2700 años, si no más. En cuanto a Egipto si se habla del imperio estrictamente egipcio, realmente el imperio egipcio dominado por egipcios es hasta el año 340 a.c. de ahí en adelante no se puede considerar imperio egipcio ya que pasó a ser parte del imperio persa, hasta la llegada de Alejandro III de Macedonia y pasó a ser parte del imperio macedonio hasta la caída de estos y ser reemplazados por los romanos, en resumidas cuentas el imperio egipcio no es tan longevo como la gente cree, la historia egipcia al igual que la romana si es más amplia, pero no ha legado tanto como los romanos, sobre todo en temas legislativos, logísticos, militares, tecnológicos, arquitectónicos... al menos para la cultura occidental, eso si, Egipto fue una gran civilización de la cual sus sucesores aprendieron mucho."

Their traditional gods were a pale imitation of Greek mythology, mere colourless ghosts silently accepted for the benefit of social convention. In no way were those gods allowed to interfere with ""real"" life. When consulted, they had to give oracles through the medium of their priests, but they were never supposed to confer moral laws upon men or to direct their actions. The Roman Empire’s sole goal in its long existence was to expand and flourish at the expense of the countless nations they invaded, nevertheless, they did have a refined intellectual and aesthetic taste despite their somewhat purely materialistic outlook on life. It’s still so crazy to me how different the Romans were from the Greeks when it came to theological beliefs, although sadly this fact gets overlooked by many people these days whenever the Roman Empire or the Greeks are brought up during history lessons."

559,UgzKEIQyI0RaCVMPX_N4AaABAg,iPAwnvyN6xw,"Rome. The most celebrated city in the world at the time of Christ. It is said to have been founded B.C. 753. When the New Testament was written, Rome was enriched and adorned with the spoils of the world, and contained a population estimated at 1,200,000, of which the half were slaves, and including representatives of nearly every nation then known. It was distinguished for its wealth and luxury and profligacy. The empire of which it was the capital had then reached its greatest prosperity.On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem ""strangers from Rome,"" who doubtless carried with them back to Rome tidings of that great day, and were instrumental in founding the church there. Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years (Acts 28:30, 31) ""in his own hired house."" While here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus (Acts 27:2), Timothy (Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:1), Tychicus (Eph. 6: 21), Epaphroditus (Phil. 4:18), and John Mark (Col. 4:10). (See [538]PAUL.)Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called ""catacombs,"" which were used from about the time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of worship and burial. About four thousand inscriptions have been found in the catacombs. These give an interesting insight into the history of the church at Rome down to the time of Constantine."

They thought every object has its own spirit, which should be appeased or supplicated if you want something from it, or to avoid its wrath. The Hellenic pantheon was only adopted gradually over time in a piecemeal fashion. Emphasis always remained on Demeter, who had far less of a ""directed personality"" than Ceres, and Saturn, who, despite the association Kronos, was not a syncretic addition, but an autocthonic aboriginal development with its own attributes and origin myth.This video is why you should never try to learn history from YouTube unless you enjoy looking like a moron and being publicly mocked."

All of them rapresent some common concept. Like nature, love, war, commerce and sea travel. Surely all of them have the same indo-european cultural origin"" the fact that there are greek gods that are correspective of italic ones doesn't mean they were copied. Portunud is one of the anciest god of the italic tribes and so was tellus, but its' only natural that ancient people had a god of earth like gaia. Mamers was the first god of the oscan tribes and predates the arrival of the greeks as he wasn't exactly the god of war but the god of youth and the defensor of the land. Then cloacina is not aphrodites as she was the goddes of sewers, so no correlation and Bona dea was worshipped in umbria so not in magna graecia and was the goddes of water springs. Then again i've only wrote some of the italic gods but there are a lot more of them and they were all equally worshipped because italic tribes were very utilitaristic and believed in the pax deorum so even the god that protected cows were keep in high consideration. I'll list some other latin/oscan gods : Caligine, Carmenta, Concordia, Conso, Cura, Dis pater, Epona, Feronia, Febris, Flora, Fontus, Fortuna, Furrina, Giuturna, Iuventas, Mefite, Opi, Ore , Pale, Pax, Robigus, Rumina, Terminus, Tiberino, Vaticano, Sterculo, Vesta, Anna perenna, Aesculano, Abbundantia.

907,UgwmBNaUjgxnZKIXmoR4AaABAg.8cHoIA02ePj9KXBFlscs6F,UgwmBNaUjgxnZKIXmoR4AaABAg,"@aquila Roman mythology is so heavily influenced by Greek mythology that it hurts me whenever people say Greek and Roman mythology. First, the Ancient Greeks colonized the whole Mediterranean in the Archaic age (around 8th century B.C.) and they even had a special name for the colonies in the Italian peninsula: Megali Hellas (known as Magna Grecia). I doubt Rome was even founded by the time Greeks settled in southern Italy.It's not only the mythology, it's even the Latin language. It was heavily based on Ancient Greek. Of course, Ancient Greek was also inspired by the Phoenician language, but they didn't have vowels, which Greeks invented.The Roman constitution of the Roman Republic. If you look at the Spartan Constitution (made by Lycourgus around 9th century B.C.), you will see similarities in the offices that wielded most of the political power (2 Consuls - 2 kings, Senate - Gerousia, Tribunes - Ephors, etc.), while you can similarities of the roman assemblies to the meetings of both Sparta and Athens.Finally, about that list you mentioned, I have to say the following.Pomona - no counterpartVerdumno - no counterpart (same story with Pomona)Portunus - MelicertesBellona - EnyoJanus - no counterpartKerres (I presume you mean Ceres) - DemetraAio Locutio - no counterpartBona dea - Possibly a version of Demetra, but nevertheless her worship was copied by Magna Grecia, who were Greek settlers in the Archaic AgeCloacina - AphroditeQuirinus - An epithet of Janus or Hercules, or another version of RomulusTellus - GaiaLupercus - PanSalus - HygeiaMamers - AresAnd I think that all these gods you listed combined (barring Janus) were less important to the average Roman citizen than any of the Roman major god mentioned in the video, that originate from Greek Mythology."

Before this time all Europeans had the typical Mediterranean appearance and what changed this (mainly in the north) were the invasions of the aryans.. Aryans were a people originally from the same place the other Europeans were from so it was just a rejoining back to their own people.. the reason for the difference in appearance was the fact that these people were seperated from each other in different environments for about 25,000 years."

Another thing, the good old orcs come from orcus and later italian stories on it/similar monsters (they were so popular that people started calling even monsters slightly similar to orcs 'orcs', like grendel in bewoulf, orcus is more similar to the 'warcraft variant but with black boar-like fur, and to the ogres of lotr)"

The later men named this country, Italy, from the name of the King Italian. Those princes were the descendants of our generation ... "". Strabo also mentions that Roman writer Koilio accepts that Rome is ""Greek is a building"" and many more that want more profound research.

1032,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg.8bykKAJIAwL8qtFku34_Tg,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg,"@Thomas Papapavlidis You btw, are glossing over the fact that even if the romans were in fact a greek colony (which there is no proof of outside legends. I should point out that initial aristocracy spoke greek and Etruscan and not latin. But that wasn't uncommon), Romans slowly turned away from Greece as they went further north and south of Italy, and seeing how culture departed away from their own and how they were more latin than anything. By the time of the punic wars, Rome was fully Latin and greek became insignificant in bureaucracy, Greek would come back in popularity after the conquest of Greece for foreign easter bureaucracy (as usual for the Romans). Sulla would bring the border of Italy up to Rome, caesar as consul up to Florentia and tyrrean islands, and finally Augustus up to Switzerland (Helvetia) and Dalmatia (more changes would be made in the future). The reason why romans initially saw themselves as Greek is because they came to hate the Etruscans, but as the unification of Italy came about the Romans became more distant from the Greeks and more Italian as the differences between Romans and other Italics became noticeably lesser than the actual Hellenistic greeks (Rome initial contact with hellenist kingdoms was the other Italian colonies. The difference wasn't noticeable yet)."
1033,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg.8bykKAJIAwL8gXFWLfzIyP,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg,"You know about the Tyrrhenians? Pelasgians? And secondly, I am referring to mythology for an ancient commemoration when the Aegean was still land and at this moment we are talking there are many buried cities in the water. Greek culture is the final result, the final product of all these cultures that sprang into the Aegean earth. Dionysios the Alikarnasses (A ""Introduction) characterizes the Etruscan Greeks, who, along with the Lycians and other Pelasgians, settled in Italy. He himself, like Diodorus Sikeliotis, Thucydides and Strabo, asserts that the Tyrrhenians (Etruscans) were the ancient Greeks of the Tyrsians, who from the Tursa of Asia Minor and other parts of the Aegean area fell to Italy along with other Pelasgians.I do not say that, the ancient writers say. This. Good luck."
1034,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg.8bykKAJIAwL8e1J9d8n3Se,Ugxf91aTUnVXYxeJw1F4AaABAg,"Well, I disagree. The Early Italian Civilizations developed around the same time as the Greeks. The Greeks began building colonies in Italy around the same time the Etrsucans, Ligurians, Early Venetians, Messapians, Oscans, Umbrians and Early Sicilians inhabited Italy. The fact that they mentioned the Trojans migrating to Italy was just mythology, that was written after the formation of the Roman Empire, and the Punic Wars. Also, after looking at a map circa 500-400 BC, you will see that the northernmost Greek settlement in Italy was around Naples. The Romans most likely guessed their ancestry in the book (Forgot what it was called), as the Romans a century or two before destroyed almost all of the Etrsucan scriptures, and in turn forgot their true ancestors. I'm not trying to start an argument, but I simply disagree with you."

He is an eastern God (on of the so-called New gods) that the Romans imported during the Empire age and adopted as their own (see also Sol Invictus, Gea Mater Deorum). Having said that, all the classic gods themselves are also adopted from the Greeks or at least adapted, so the only truly ""Roman"" gods out there would be the early Latin/Italic deities. Most of these were later abandoned but the Romans did keep Ianus and Quirinus, for some time at least"

1046,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg.8by-0GTS1IA8f1fHMIV0q2,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg,"The Underworld is called Erebus/Erebos or sometimes Hades. The Greek God of the Underworld is Hades and the Roman one is Pluto, but the Romans focused more on him as the god of wealth. Orcus, on the other hand, is the God of Broken Vows who guards the River Styx and ensures no one breaks a vow. Of course, the etymology of the word Pluto may come from Greek but he is 100% a Roman God. Trust me, for about 3 years I've been studying the Graeco-Roman pantheons. I know what I'm saying."

1049,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg.8by-0GTS1IA8byneyrtWch,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg,"You both made me research it again. From what I found, Hades is the most ancient name for the Greek god, with Pluto - Pluton to be exact - being added later. Since then ""Hades"" mostly described the kingdom of the Underworld, but was still used as the name of the god.The same however goes with ""Orcus"". It was both the name of the place and the god. And the reason I mentioned it in my first comment is because no one who is intrested in Greco-Roman mythology seems to know it.So maybe, just like Apollo, Pluto's name could have been borrowed with a Latin twist (Apollon-> Apollo  // Pluton->  Pluto). I ""insist"" on the name Pluton being of Greek origin because it appears to have an etymological relation with Plutos (Latinised Plutus), the Greek god of wealth. The etymology itself must be referring to the ground, as both of them were chthonic deities, the first one ruling and living in the Underworld and the second one offering the treasures of the ground."
1050,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg.8by-0GTS1IA8by_EVzqOzB,Ugx_qgRAmqb0uLgtnF94AaABAg,Pluto is the Roman name for the god. If you are talking Greek mythology Hades is both the god and the place

I will give one note though, Uranus and Gaia are only the Greek names for the pair of deities you display in the grandparent generation. However, to the Romans they were known as Caelus and Terra or Tellus Mater respectively and were classed as Primordial Deities rather than Titans along with multiple others of the generation or generations  before the Titans - the parentage and familial lines of these beings gets pretty fuzzy in comparison to that of the later ones in both the Roman and Greek variations.

Also Norse Myths are better recorded, since Norse Believes lasted longer than Germanic Ones there were manuscripts of Norse Myths that survived into the modern era (granted you can kinda tell with some sources that the authors were recently converted Christians who were trying to make their old believes coincide with their new believes, for example there’s a version of Ragnorok where the only survivors are one God, a man, a woman, and a Garden)"

1347,UgwgREIMU7ldyCDm_UZ4AaABAg,iPAwnvyN6xw,"The Romans, when they came into contact with the Greeks, began equating their own gods to the Greek gods when they served the same function and would adapt elements from Greek mythology to ""supplement"" their own. However most Roman gods were already around prior to the contact with the Greeks. The idea that Romans ""ripped off"" Greek religion is a bit of a popular misconception.Most Roman deities were actually adapted from the Etruscans or neighbouring Italian tribes. The gods and religion of early Iron Age Italy likely shared a common ancestor with those of the Greeks (likely from a Proto-Indo-European people ancestral to both the Greeks and Italians from before they diverged and settled into their respective landmasses), hence the similarities.The Romans eventually copied the Greek myths and the Greek ""family tree of the gods"" and retroactively applied them to their own equivalents of those gods. Though that said those equivalents weren't always 100% exactly and the Romans didn't necessarily copy Greek elements if they weren't ""compatible"".The Romans also eventually imported foreign gods that they had no equivalent of and just added them to their existing Pantheon, such as Isis or Cybele, some of which became more popular among the Romans than most of their 'native' gods."

The Latins, Faliscans and various Sabellics do share a reasonably close common prehistoric ancestor with the Greeks, as do the Celts but slightly more distantly.The Etruscans, being surrounded by Indo-Europeans on all sides, did undergo their own process of assimilating and adapting elements from Indo-European religion, making things even more complicated.Though, yes, some originally non-Indo-European elements likely bled through into Roman religion through the Etruscans."

1418,Ugx_2dSb-FDmJLtjY7p4AaABAg,FeiSVnKzV1w,"i do believe a lot of the Romulus and Remus story. people have been actually raised by animals like the story of Dina Sanichar, the story of the roman god mars coming down from heaven is like in the bible verse (Genesis 11:5) except god does not rape but instead looks at the sinful city of Babylon , alba longa is actually a historical place, Romulus ascending to heaven is like the story of Enoch and Elijah, in 2020 archelogies found a tomb which could be the tomb of Romulus and in 2007 they also found postholes of a ancient dwelling and they were made in about 750 BC 3 years after Rome was founded"

Romulus' birth by a virgin woman, going to heaven without dying and reappearing to a person to command him to spread Rome and conquer the world echoes Jesus' story. Maybe Jesus' story was based on Romulus' story. Maybe the Israelites under the Roman rule wanted to create a story similar to the Rome's origin story with little changes to mock them....like how the Kingdom of Rome began with their King Romulus, the Kingdom of God/Israelites would begin with their King of the Jews, the Messiah, Jesus Christ whose story is very similar to the Romulus' story"

This is why there is such similarities between Earth Mythology and Several Aliens in Star Trek. Including the name of the Klingon Home world Qo'noS, similar to the Ancient Greek ruler of the Underworld Cronus, before Hades. Additionally, Klingon Legend states that the Klingons Slew all their gods. Makes me wonder if that species who masqueraded as gods met their end by the Klingons on Qo'noS.

(Mal abgesehen davon, dass alles, was mit ""romulanisch"" tituliert wird immer besser ist als die Produkte der ""Konkurrenzvölker xD)D´tan war der kleine Junge in Spocks Dissidentengruppe auf Romulus in Star Trek -TNG und in der erweiterten Storyline von Star Trek Online der Anführer der romulanischen Republik, die nach der Zerstörung Romulus` die Völker der Remaner und Romulaner vereint hat und sich permanent den Befehlen der nach wie vor existierenden imperialen Ordnung und damit dem Tal Shiar und der Kaiserin Sela (Tochter von Tasha Yar; ebenfalls TNG) widersetzt."
1764,UgghCadFP4g5LHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-RFN47-KVLPQEyxg,UgghCadFP4g5LHgCoAEC,"@Das Vadder Hi hi, ganz vielen Dank, Das Vadder!! Ja, ich nehme doch an, dass dieses hier noch zur Anti-Desertations-Musik der Romulaner wird.Ich habe natürlich wieder mal eine relativ eingängige Melodie versucht zu erzeugen.    Witzig ist, dass ich ursprünglich den ""Klingonen-Raumflottenmarsch"" vorhatte hochzuladen - der war nämlich in Noten schon geschrieben und auch recht eingängig. Aber dann schob sich in Blitzeseile der ""Raumflottenmarsch der Romulaner"" in den Vordergrund. Übrigens ist das ganze Stück eine IMPROVISATION - also gar nicht wirklich komponiert. Aber durch die heutige Technik ist's möglich, durch Aneinanderreihung von Audioschnitten der Motivik ein ganzes Stück in Windeseile zu ""produzieren"".  Ist auch bei der ""cadassianischen Hymne"" das erste Mal ""passiert"". Eigentlich hasse ich Märsche leidenschaftlich, aber sie zu komponieren macht irrsinnigen Spaß.  Nochmals, ganz herzlichen Dank, für Deinen - wie immer - herrlich innovativen Kommentar (sooo genau wie Du kenne ich die romulanische Geschichte nämlich gar nicht!),LG aus NRW/OWL,Follka H. ;))))))))))"
1765,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,ooS0Hop_zhk,I like this song. It sounds like pride within the song   And their is no match nor hope to stop such a fleet. I guess that romulan pride at its best I take it.  
1766,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY28gqerDgDoao,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,FINNALLY star trek gets its imperial March.
1767,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY28gEomk2PSpM,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,"I agree the RSE lost all legitimacy as an institution the moment they sold their own people to the Elachi. Nevertheless, I bet the Republic will become more like a Roman Republic in nature than a Fed-like ""democracy"" as D'Tan hopes. D'Tan is a good leader and managed to rally the scattered Romulans under a reconstruction project, but his ideals are too ""westernized"". In the end, a romulan Triumvirate will reestablish imperial glory like Caesar did, a new empire that serves the interests of the Romulan race rather than betraying it for hopes of more power."
1768,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY288wX3D-7tMR,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,"+Fedorahatter  More like they want to make the entire Romulan race pay for Sela shooting at one of them 200,000 years ago when she and the player went back in time to the moment when the Iconians were being destroyed by those races who hated and feared them for being too advanced."
1769,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY288wWhGcwpAl,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,"+Fedorahatter  It already IS fading into nothingness and given that it either ignored the needs of its citizens and stole Fed aid meant for the Romulan people or handed over anyone who didn't serve the RSE without question to the Elachi to be turned into more Elachi, the RSE doesn't deserve to exist anymore! Long live the Republic!!"
1770,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY271y8wWltvdM,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,@Fedorahatter perhaps. however the romulan star empire is far more experienced than the romulan republic and the empire has more experience starship crews.       
1771,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AsY271xgiux5sC1,UghMJXifHRTBFngCoAEC,@Fedorahatter i doubt it. the romulan star empire will be reborn in war.

1776,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC.7-H0Z7-90i59AP95j8kTQe,Ugi22wTfpbQ7engCoAEC,Ovviamente Romolo fondò Roma e Remo era il suo fratello gemello. Nel mito furono gli dei a decidere chi tra i due avrebbe fondato la città.

Ma se ci fosse un collegamento tra le due civiltà?  Le cellule degli antichi romani saranno volate nello spazio arrivando su Vulcano dove si saranno fuse con le cellule originali vulcaniane. In seguito alla guerra civile vulcaniana vinta dalla ""Raptor  Faction "", i vulcaniani vinti (  quelli con le cellule romane ) lasciarono Vulcano e raggiunsero i pianeti Romolus e Remus (tradotti in italiano Romolo e Remo ) e si rinominarono in Remani e Romulani. Ecco perché c'é il latino."

1809,Ugwf49B4Ms97oNorU594AaABAg,t6M5sFXKRcY,"Long ago in the kingdom of Alba longa lived a king named Numato, he was a magnificent ruler and had a beautiful daughter named Sylvia, Sylvia had a wicked brother Julius who overthrew Numato and took the throne for himself. Amilia speared that his niece would give birth to the sons who might try to retake the throne in the future, so he banished Sylvia to the temple of Mars to be a vestal virgin but Mars, the God of war fell in love with her and together they had twin sons, Remus and Romulus. Once the word got to Amelia's, he furiously ordered the servants to sneak into Mars's temple that night had killed the 2 babies but when the servants arrived at the temple, they couldn't bring themselves to harm the twins so instead they decided to send them away into the Tiber River so that Amelia's wouldn't know that they had lived. The river's currents were surprisingly calm. The babies did not drown infact the cradle drifted on to a bank just at the bottom of Palentine hill. The next morning a female wolf walked down the hill to get a drink at the river but when she did, she stumbled upon Remus and Romulus but instead of gobbling them up like any other wolf would do, she saved them and took them into her care like they were her own pups. When the boys grew up a shepherd names Posthumous found and took them from the Female Wolf and raised them. They grew up to be strong young men and would spread to the twin where the former king Numato had been banished to he realized that the boys were his grandsons and decided to have them come to him. When they arrived Numato explained to them everything that happened. He also informed them that they needed to overthrow Amelia's and take the throne from him. Romulus and Remus gathered an army of men, raided the kingdom and killed their wicked uncle. Once Numato was back on his throne, his grandsons decided that they wanted to start a city of their own but they were unable to decide where to build it so they decided to build their own separate cities but while they were building, Remus started to mock Romulus for having such low walls and leapt over them to prove his point. Romulus got angry and killed his brother in rage without hesitation and exclaimed, ""SO PERISH EVERYONE THAT SHALL HEREAFTER LEAP OVER MY WALL!"""

You just took some historical liberties, and twisted them in a way to get your point across. He wasn't called Alexander of Greece, or Ellada, because there was no Greece back then. There were Greek city-states. They were divided yes, but they were all Greek. He isn't called Alexander of Greece, just like Archimedes isn't referred as Archimedes of Greece, but Archimedes of Syracuse, or Eudoxus who is referred as Eudoxus of Knidos. The fact that he wasn't called Alexander of Greece, doesn't mean that he wasn't Greek. It's because Greece didn't exist back then. He wasn't called Alexander of Greece, but he was called Strategos Autokrator of Greece. Sratigos in greek means commander, and autokrator emperor. So he was basically called Emperor Commander of Greece. Furthermore, he believed that he was descended from Herakles from his father's side, and Achilles from his mother's side. Both are Greek mythical heroes. He worshiped Greek gods, especially Zeus who he was particularly fond of, because his mother would often tell him that he was his father. Also, his ancestors come from Argos, a city in Peloponnese, Southern Greece. His grandfather, Alexander I , participated in the olympic games, where only Greeks were allowed to participate. There are also many instances where he referred to himself as Greek. He famously said: ""Ευχαριστώ τοις Θεοίς ότι εγεννήθην Έλλην"" (I thank the gods for being born Greek). He said that he was Greek many times, and it was for Greece that he fought and sought revenge against the Persians who had previously harmed them. Moreover, building a huge statue of a hero who doeasn't belong to you, doesn't give you more claim to him. Go find another history to steal, you uneducated fuck."
2351,UgxnQikO00VW4A1OSzR4AaABAg.8vKkx0XcF2S8vUsqYYSMuv,UgxnQikO00VW4A1OSzR4AaABAg,"@Violator  look you are boring with your story, Alexander of Macedonia, not of Greece, not of elada, not of ellas, not of greky.... Macedonia has always Kings and royalties, you, filozofers, actors, musicians, story tellers, democracy, he kills lot of Athenians, he occupied Athens, they hate him. Suddenly he is your national hero???  You only now put on ridicules small monument of him. Pathetic .

Rome was busy fighting Cartage (remember Hanibal, and his father early) Rome look like 3 world country?  So Alexander has not really economic reason to get involved with Rome. Letter after his death their was 100 years war. The story about Rome now is born in the 15/16 sentury by Vatican, so Greece and Rome become favorite country to create a story about history (fake history) even the calendar and the number of senturis are not correct."
