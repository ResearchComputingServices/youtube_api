127,Ugxd_dRmVWSJqCNZImJ4AaABAg.9V9xEN21vRd9WTW5L9DU0u,Ugxd_dRmVWSJqCNZImJ4AaABAg,"If it irritates your skin it's probably due to lye not being mixed enough. Lye pockets form and can cause 3rd degree burns. Wait 4 weeks before using cold process soap. If your soap is crumbly, has white spots then don't use it. When you are using the immersion blender I recommend putting it at an angle so it sucks in the oil from the top, kind of like a mini whirlpool. Also don't get soda ash mixed up with lye pockets, if your soap becomes ""ashy"" or a little white it's fine it's just aesthetic."

134,UgyxRkfOPVkZY_D-W6p4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  I am new to soap making and am trying to understand how to work with palm oil.  I have learned from Brambleberry that the palm oil needs to be fully liquified before use (in order to incorporate and use all the fatty acids.).  But if I'm usingpPalm oil that starts in solid form and I only need 9 oz of it, how do I avoid having to melt the entire 32 oz jar of Palm oil with each batch (thus remelting it multiple times)?  If you have any insight on that, I would be grateful.  Thank you so much!"

169,UgxAHnQ4Tg5jupS3YrF4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"You do need to specify which type of lye you are using, Sodium Hydroxide or Potassium Hydroxide.  I can tell from the video you used Potassium Hydroxide, but others that are inexperienced may not be able to tell.  Sodium Hydroxide will make a hard bar of soap, whereas the Potassium Hydroxide will make a soft gel soap, which can then be made into liquid soap.  The sodium is what makes for a hard bar of soap, and some old recipes that use wood ash lye (which is Potassium Hydroxide) will call for the addition of salt to increase the sodium content and harden the soap into a bar.  The old soap recipes that made soft gel soap, would be used to make laundry soap.  The soft gel would be stored in a container with a lid. When it was time for washing clothes, a dab of soap on a couple of fingers would be worked into the collars, cuffs, and stains on the damp article of clothing and worked in to begin lifting the dirt.  The clothes would then go into a tub of boiling hot water with a bit more gel soap and agitation would begin.  Boiling water was a necessity to both fully dissolve the soap, and to kill any germs that may be present.  Todays laundry products are detergents, which is a totally different concoction, and can be formulated to be used in cold wash water."

243,UgyqmieIF-4GlP0XCf54AaABAg.9KFccZuOwvv9KqO_rZy9-X,UgyqmieIF-4GlP0XCf54AaABAg,"Unfortunately you can't make soap from scratch without lye. I know in some countries lye is considered an illegal substance - it is where I originally come from. In which case, you might want to look at crafting soap with melt and pour bases, or if it is available to you, rebatch soap bases (which are essentially cold process soap bits but that have already saponified). Where I come from there were soap companies that rented out their soap studio space to you at an hourly fee and you could use a limited amount of lye provided by them (because they had paid the government money to secure a license to use lye). So you might want to see which of those options are available to you! All the best!"
244,Ugwe_Irndd_uB2ySV1N4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Hi, just saw your video.  I was wondering where can I buy some of the ingredients in this recipe.  The lye  and the fragrance.  Or any of the other more uncommon ingredients also the mold for the soap should I but it on Ebay?  And do I need a thermomitor?"
245,Ugwe_Irndd_uB2ySV1N4AaABAg.9K6oPF2BBlI9K76nQxm-sp,Ugwe_Irndd_uB2ySV1N4AaABAg,"And yes you need a thermometer, I use an infrared thermometer that you don’t have to stick in the oils/lye, but I think other people use regular thermometers. You need it to make sure the oil mixture and lye solution are close in temperature and not too hot"
246,Ugwe_Irndd_uB2ySV1N4AaABAg.9K6oPF2BBlI9K76fJEg5gB,Ugwe_Irndd_uB2ySV1N4AaABAg,You can get all of it on Amazon
247,UgyUpTvx9K0qCzctr8J4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,What is the PH of this when it’s cured? Do you find this drying??
248,UgyUpTvx9K0qCzctr8J4AaABAg.9K6_vxw8EpO9K6vDaafF-9,UgyUpTvx9K0qCzctr8J4AaABAg,"no i don't find it drying at all.  i don't test the PH of my finished soaps, i just wait 3 weeks before i use them."

252,UgzXxVwzUBHtkWukbEN4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Hello Just finished watching your recipe for soap. I was wondering do you have to use lye can you use another ingredient instead of lye. Sounds dangerous to use. Another lady used lye
253,Ugz7MI6LgeVwhAAqCRR4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Hiiiii , wow thnx so much for sharing! What color did you use , it is lovely!!!!"

256,UgyQke5djiiRcV6ecsV4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Hello, I have watched your video of homemade soap.  I am so interesting on your complete recipe and instructions therefore I want to make my own soap. Unfortunately stick blender you used in your video is rare in my town. I live in suburb area. Is it possible if I use a common food blender? I have much time during the pandemic and stay at home. I want to fill it by making my own soap.  Thanks anyway"

262,Ugx3spEHMWYff2QrAFB4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,I made this a copy of days ago using the crockpot hot process method. I used a bar  the next day. It is amazing!  I absolutely love it. I have been making soap for several years. This one immediately went to my three favorite soap recipes list I'm already planning on making a second batch as part of my friends and family gift bags I'm preparing. My soapmaking hobby has been on steroids thanks to covid. Loving every minute of it. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.
263,Ugx3spEHMWYff2QrAFB4AaABAg.9JF0Pzxtz-V9hlh15C0lOj,Ugx3spEHMWYff2QrAFB4AaABAg,Ohh wow that's great. I'm going to try this out. I would love to know the other soap recipes you love.
264,UgwzsZqhv8797mlu_HV4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Thank You!  Probably going to try soap making as I near retirement.  I’m always buying the stuff off of locals.  Made lye soap as a kid for  a school project.
265,UgxgbgWrKViT2WM9Nl14AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"I haven't started yet,  but I've watched a few videos. Yours videos by far is the best I've seen,  because you are thorough in your explanation of the steps taken, the ingredients used, and the process applied, so that your viewers understand COMPLETELY what is needed for this wonderful hobby which I am so excited about embarking on. Thank you, so much. And I just like and subscribed. Be blessed"
266,UgzxjsdPyGqdhVbU7sx4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,SO how do you make soap with different colors? Or multiple colored soap. How do you determine the amount of everything?
267,UgxoQGfmmFtCjSk8AYd4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Very good video! Thank you
268,Ugy3KaeXCTkOvjJ8OVF4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Hi Katie. I did my very first soap batch with this recipe. I got brave and decided to split it into two funnel cups, coloring one orange with Saffron (expensive stuff!) dissolved into ""borrowed"" oils from the main pot) and the other cup brown, using brown oxide dissolved into ""borrowed"" oils from the main pot. I scented the orange with Brazillian Orange oil, and the brown with Brambleberry's Espresso scent (both scents heavenly!) I call my mix ""Orange Cappucino""... Anyways my problem: I ALMOST wound up with ""Soap on a Stick"", because it started hardening so fast.I only stick blended the main pot for about 20 seconds, and hurried through blending the colorants and scents at the last second. I used one Loaf mold and a couple small square molds (one with a splash-ripple pattern, the other with Elephants in it.) It's these two little molds where the two layers didn't blend, and set a little clumpy inbetween.The Loaf mold did fine, but I had to smooth down the top with a rubber spatula because it was setting so fast.OK. so you have the basic picture. I'm wondering how critical the temperature at which I added the Lye mixture is. note: I did NOT use Sodium Lactate. Would it have really made matters worse, or is the Sodium Lactate a more ""Long term"" effect, coming into play during the 6 seek curing time?I measured the temperature of the main pot and the lye, and noticed that the digital thermometer would go up as I stired it around and stabalize after about 5 seconds. That's what I assumed to be the correct temperature.I mixed the Lye into the oils at between 115 degrees F, and 120 degrees F. I know your recipe said 100 to 110. Why? Do you think the higher temperature makes it set sooner? I was concerned that the heavy fats (Palm Oil and coconut oil, and Mango butter) would solidify the closer they got to body temp (98 degrees), so thought I'd go ahead and pour at the temperature that I did.What do you think? Suggestions? Wish I could send you pictures. Actually I'm pretty proud of myself, (for a first effort), since my wife loves the scents and says we'll definetly use it when it's ready..."
269,Ugw0tsYEf_7-taah4UF4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Please where do you get your oils?

276,Ugy1jiTDLJLx5JC70l94AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,I’ve watched your video a couple of times and I want to give this soap a try. It will be my first soapmaking experience. Can I make this soap in layers of different colors? Will I need to spray alcohol in between the layers so they stick together?
277,Ugy1jiTDLJLx5JC70l94AaABAg.9IkigJeuMq-9IyMuU71oza,Ugy1jiTDLJLx5JC70l94AaABAg,Thanks for the great info. That will save me lots of trouble. Looks like a wonderful recipe. I’m in the process of getting all the items needed. This will be my first try at it. Thanks again.
278,Ugy1jiTDLJLx5JC70l94AaABAg.9IkigJeuMq-9Iy9nclUYwE,Ugy1jiTDLJLx5JC70l94AaABAg,"I don't know about the alcohol, but I just did this in two colors and almost got soap on a stick, because it set so quick. So work very fast if you're going to split it, and add colors and fragrance. I only stick blended the main pot for 20 seconds, then split it into two funnel cups to add the color and fragrance, and stick blended the colors for maybe 10 seconds for each funnel cup, and already it was a very thick trace. Had to work quickly to get my two layers into the molds."
279,UgyVMSDWRUz9YEDH5Wx4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Wow, wonder what our ancestors did while tending the fire to make lye with kids running around.   This generation are afraid of thier own shadows. Who knew making soap was so dangerous."

282,Ugzu-g0bedjDJ1NxqUR4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Hello there. Going to use this recipe for my very first soap project. What's that red fragrance powder and where do I get it? What's your favorite scent? I looked below at other comments and then on Brambleberry.com but can't find fragrance POWDER. All I see is oil. Can you provide a link to that red stuff you used here?
283,Ugzu-g0bedjDJ1NxqUR4AaABAg.9IH-U7Q_GNo9ILpqjztfDb,Ugzu-g0bedjDJ1NxqUR4AaABAg,"hi, the powder is just color.  the fragrances are fragrance oils  (my very favorite is mango mango from brambleberry!)"
284,Ugzu-g0bedjDJ1NxqUR4AaABAg.9IH-U7Q_GNo9IH4IPitXxn,Ugzu-g0bedjDJ1NxqUR4AaABAg,"I believe the fragrance is a oil, the pink/red powder is the color. Probably a mica powder. Look for colorants on Brambleberry."

286,UgxZzYW8X4vkjXDM0Mp4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,can I use this recipe without palm oil? would it make much of a difference
287,Ugx2OrZwIoZlOFc6xVB4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,My stick blender makes a million bubbles in the soap
288,Ugx2OrZwIoZlOFc6xVB4AaABAg.9I6kXP1oVoN9JoyOPEFI_u,Ugx2OrZwIoZlOFc6xVB4AaABAg,You are lifting it too close to the top and letting too much air and after you pour your soap in the mold tap it several times on a hard surface in the air bubble s should all release
289,Ugx36QPpC1lfuyBtuap4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Will this recipe leave that harsh dry feeling on the skin once it is rinsed off? I recently made some melt and pour soap and it felt similar to the yellow dial soap bar once i rinsed it leaving my skin extremely dry!

295,UgxXHbLaWZSi7NYGiw94AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,I love your videos and this recipe is amazing!! First off you possess such a genuine kindness that makes the videos even easier to watch. My first batch ever came out perfect with your recipe. When I tried changing things a little I ran into some bumps lol. Your videos are great for first time soap makers. I do have some friends with an avocado allergy though. What’s the best thing to substitute with and still get the same great soap? Do you change anything else when making the substitution? Thanks so much!
296,UgxXHbLaWZSi7NYGiw94AaABAg.9I0qvGhnKx59I5v0kumoZb,UgxXHbLaWZSi7NYGiw94AaABAg,"thank you brandon!  i would replace the avocado oil with more olive or almond oil.  any time you chance a soap recipe you'll want to run it through a lye calculator.  my favorite is from mountain sage.  you just enter in the amounts of your new recipe, hit calculate, and it tells you how much lye to use.  you'lll want a 5% or 6% superfat (that will make sense once you use the calculator)"

What do you think about putting goats milk in this recipe? Also which measurement do you use for your lye solution? Oh, one more thing...do you ever use oxides in your soap when I have tried it the oxide usually comes off on the cloth, am I doing something wrong or is it normal?"

Feeling textures, fragrances colours etc is becoming passion. Now there is a question::: The major component in any soap is oil then why we name soaps by adding little quantity of goat milk  or  water malon or  oats etc? Why we not give soaps name after the basic oil?"

364,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Been makings soaps for about 4 years now, and love watching other Soapmaking videos from others! (Funny story) This is the 1st time I've ever come across your channel, but interestingly enough, I wasn't searching for soap videos at all. Loved your video, and the soap came out nice! I like how you speak clearly and make it easy for those who are new, to understand. Not many channels do that.1 tip I would like to mention. Don't use Pyrex (or any type of glass) for mixing your lye solution. It seems like a good idea, but lye actually etches the glass, weakening it over time, and can eventually cause it to shatter. Many Soapmakers have had this happen to them before. Stainless Steel is recommended, or a plastic container (with a Recycle Code of #2 or #5 only) can also be used."
365,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg.9FeRnG5-HEZ9aobU8iSNzS,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg,"@YBLate I hope this link is ok with the Channel Owner, to post. Just showing what a Cold Process Volcano can look like if it gets too hot (this can happen from mixing too hot, or from additives that increase the temperature). https://youtu.be/_H2S82Wb9_AThis volcano from this video clip added honey, which the sugars in honey raises the temperature of the batter, and caused it to volcano inside the mould. (It's not necessarily an eruption, but rather similar to bread rising from yeast).In Hot Process, volcanos aren't that much of an issue because it happens during the cook phase, before moulding."
366,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg.9FeRnG5-HEZ9aoQNMlRmLx,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg,"@Khione yeah for base oils we measure in litres purely to save time; originally the recipes were weighed in grams but the measurements were converted to mls later. We also don't pour anything into a mould if that makes any difference, we let it set in the tray it's mixed in, I've never heard of soap exploding though and don't think it's ever happened or I imagine it would have been mentioned. I only started working there about three months ago and have no knowledge prior to that, which is why I'm so curious"
367,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg.9FeRnG5-HEZ9an0DWXGXnT,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg,"@YBLate I'm a bit concerned that you are referring to the oils listed in liters. You don't measure by weight? You mentioned that everything is set aside after being melted, so I would assume that it would cool down by the time you get around to making it. Larger batches run the most risk of volcanoing if mixed at too hot of a temp, because the mass traps the heat easier. It's the heat that causes a Volcano. If you have not had this happen, either the temp has cooled down enough by the time you make it, or refrigerating it could help to keep the temp down as well. Cold Process soap can easily reach temps of around 150-200*F inside the mould (even when mixed at room temp). The more the mass, the more heat is retained."
368,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg.9FeRnG5-HEZ9amzXAukY-Z,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg,"@Khione thank you for the response, I appreciate you typing all that out! I work for a vegan soap company, what we do is we mix the lye and water in larger batches (over 1kg of lye, over 2L of water and about 10-11L of oils) we stir the lye and water for about 30 seconds before adding all the base oils and additives in at regular room temperature (hard oils are heated until melted and set aside until needed, but we don't melt to a set temperature), we then blend to trace and let it set by itself, later cutting the slab using a hydraulic press (good for about 100 100g bars per slab)So I guess I was just wondering if we don't monitor the temps because for larger batches it doesn't matter, or if its a thing we don't do just to save time and effort"
369,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg.9FeRnG5-HEZ9am-odylu8p,Ugy4U7LvC7hsZQMwpzB4AaABAg,"@YBLate I have more experience with Hot Process, so I have never had to bother with waiting for the lye/oils to come to a specific temp (measuring temp in Hot Process is only necessary if you are wanting to make HTHP). Normally, I will just make my lye solution 1st, then set it aside. Then I measure all of my oils/fats/butters into the crockpot and heat all of my ingredients. Once everything has been thoroughly melted, I take my lye solution and mix with my oils. I never have to bother with temp at all, because the crockpot will be heating everything up.However, in regards to Cold Process, from my understanding from research, and friends who do Cold Process method: the temp of lye/oils being similar to each other isn't necessarily as important as them being cool in temp. As long as the lye and oils are brought down in temp (many prefer for their lye solution to be cooler than their oils), this helps to slow down the reaction. Too hot can create a Volcano inside the mould.I know many Cold Process soapmakers who make their lye solution at night, then in the morning, they melt their oils/fats/butters and allow those oils to come down to temp before mixing their room temp lye into their oils. ...Now, I will explain another method for Cold Process. However, I do NOT recommend this for a beginner. I recommend learning and becoming familiar with traditional Cold Process soapmaking 1st, before attempting this, as it is an Advanced method, and mistakes can happen! This Advanced Method is called the ""Heat Transfer"" method. This method separates the liquid oils from the fats/butters, keeping the hard fats/butters separate. Taking freshly made lye solution (while it is still very hot), pour the hot lye solution into the hard fats/butters, and stir the lye solution around slowly to melt the hard ingredients (do not use a stick blender to mix this yet). Then once melted, the liquid oils (room temp) can then be added to the now melted fats/butters/lye.As I mentioned, this is an Advanced method of Cold Process, and not recommended for beginners. Many things can go wrong when making it this way, if you are unfamiliar with the process."

But I just wanna let you know because I’m not sure you are aware but palm oil is unethically produced, the deforestation of the palm trees is destroying the homes of already endangered species like the orangutan, Pygmy elephant and Sumatran rhino.

I have a butcher friend who will set aside and then grind the fat trimmings for me so it's easier to render at home.,I've used the ""heat transfer"" method of soaping (wait 2 HOURS?) ... add the hot lye solution to the solid fats and stir until they are melted, then add in the liquid fats.

Enter them into a soap calculator (http://www.soapcalc.net/calc/soapcalcwp.asp is a popular one) When you enter the weight of the batch you want to make (usually 2.5-3 lbs for a standard beginner mold) it will do all the math and tell you how much of each ingredient you need.

458,UgwJt_xcgWOCr4pgsT14AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Hello madam, how are you doing? I'm subscriber of your channel. I don't know you know my country. This is Bangladeh. I watched a few videos on your channel that was published about one year ago . I'm interested in starting a small range of handmade soap making business from my house. I choose your recipe. But I wanted to know that How can I make mango butter. Kanak saha Dhip International Dhaka Bangladesh."
459,UgwqrABnpHg8azV4br54AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"I’m sensitive to nuts, is there another oil I can use instead of the almond oil in this recipe?"
460,UgwqrABnpHg8azV4br54AaABAg.9BmojPqKEY89Bre0gzaTWF,UgwqrABnpHg8azV4br54AaABAg,"Soap making with lye is an exact science when it comes to types of oils verses the amount of lye needed. This is extremely important, you can Not just replace an oil or change the quantity without adjusting the lye. That said you can replace or even leave out the almond oil but you will need to recalculate the lye amount. There are soap calculators available on-line to use to recalculate your measurements."
461,UgxP95qrgjzyB1GdzER4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,what type scale tells us in percent? and i am new to soaps i did mp. if i did lye how would you suggest cooking it and mixing it really safely ? by hand or is the stick blender ok
462,UgxP95qrgjzyB1GdzER4AaABAg.9BZUN420PvR9BwWZ5dZsFu,UgxP95qrgjzyB1GdzER4AaABAg,"You have to buy a percent scale! Just kidding.Percentage is preferable because no one has the same size mold and you don't want to waste oil that doesn't fit your mold.To use % you have to know the amount of oil you need for your mold. To do that you measure your mold width, depth and length and use this math...W x L x (D)desired depth x .40.5 x 3 x 1.5 x .40 = 9 ounces of total oil.So when a lye calculator asks how much oil, plug in 9 oz. and then enter the % of each oil.So if coconut is 15% of your oils then in my example coconut is 1.35 ounces out of 9 ounces in your recipe."
463,UgwdeUbG3XjxmFwDdYp4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,I plan on trying this soap out. But I I didn't see you and any fragrance too it. I was wanting g to add fragrance do I need to subtract any percent of the oils to add it.

465,UgzQydGkFtJawyoGn114AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,What oil should I use to replace the palm oil?
466,UgzlO7OYnT0Rcdtjw4x4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,How water affects the soap? Adding more or less?
467,UgzlO7OYnT0Rcdtjw4x4AaABAg.9BPIogJ2BuE9BPxteIq_68,UgzlO7OYnT0Rcdtjw4x4AaABAg,Rossy L. Less water can help the soap cure faster.  Look up “water discount for soapmakibg” and you will find some info  emoji_slightly_smiling_face 
468,Ugw4s1ujHsMLLJOSfS54AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Wow, really? I make soap for a living and I would NEVER, slap lye and water together like that! Lye water concentrations are exact measurements! You should always run a new recipe through soap calc to make sure the measurements are correct. You just don't trust every recipe you come across and you should tell your followers this. Plus they need to use only distilled water. And the reason your soap is tracing so fast is because you are soaping at to high a temperature.  Most people soap at room temperature.  Or between 80 to 85 degrees. I would suggest that you send your followers to Royalty Soaps, soap making for beginners series.  It is a good one and Katie does an excellent job teaching it and she's fun to watch. I have no problem with your recipe but you should be giving them the percentage of oils they need and not the ounces. That way they can calculate it to fit there mold."
469,Ugw4s1ujHsMLLJOSfS54AaABAg.9BOsgnLuCSC9BwNT6T31xz,Ugw4s1ujHsMLLJOSfS54AaABAg,"Oh yeah, she says that she used 40 oz of oil. For that size mold the only way she can do that is if she used a low water amount. The temperature had ALMOST nothing to do with her trace. It usually amounts to choice of oils OR low water and too much stick blending.I believe she reduced her water so she can add more oil.Stick blending alone will do it."
470,Ugw4s1ujHsMLLJOSfS54AaABAg.9BOsgnLuCSC9BwMZY-sJqo,Ugw4s1ujHsMLLJOSfS54AaABAg,"Water is not an exact measurement. The amount can be whatever you want it to to be. The only requirement is the 50/50 rule which is the minimum amount. After that, its up to you and your choice.I am sure that is what you meant though but people do read your comment. I just clarified what you meant."

I'm sure coconut oil is easier and probably cheaper but that's the way it goes."
503,UgzOlKRBr1I_9Yhk_KZ4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Please NEVER USE GLASS to mix your liquid and lye together.  It isn't a question of if it will break it is WHEN the glass will break.  It is ALWAYS advised that when people get a soap recipe off the internet that they ALWAYS run it through a lye calculator, just in case there was a typo.  You are also setting a bad precedence to new soapers by not using gloves....  I hate to say this but your recipe is close to a 3% lye ration to 14% liquid.  Especially for new soapers you shouldn't be going this low with the lye solution.  Yes this will give you more bubbles will not be very moisturizing to the skin and more bubbles usually dry the skin out.  I'm sorry but I would warn folks especially new soapers to NOT use this recipe.    I think you need to learn more about soaping before you instruct others, especially new folks to soaping."
504,UgzOlKRBr1I_9Yhk_KZ4AaABAg.9AfrPzv5y1S9KIPLRuDxjt,UgzOlKRBr1I_9Yhk_KZ4AaABAg,"True, there is no such thing as a moisturizing soap. You can only go so low with lye that it still gives you a working soap and doesn't fall apart. Lye will ""eat"" all the fat there and convert it into soap. Whatever superfat is there, it will simply disperse in between soap molecules and impede the lather a  little. Soap is for washing dirt out of skin. I used to make soap from SO MANY different oils when in frenzy of soap making, and then I thought it was a sheer waste and better to just  slap those on the skin then waste it into soap bubbles."

532,UgxzEbvptR3fy3AqeQd4AaABAg.9AG6Xtg2AUA9Bwns31t3XX,UgxzEbvptR3fy3AqeQd4AaABAg,"@Fabricated Reality About those glycerin rivers, try 1.4 > 1.85 x lyeValue = totalWater.I don't get any more rivers.The more you add water the greater you have to stick blend more then you realize which leaves loose water that you don't think is there which  can lead to rivers and even salt on top of the soap. Soap is kinda like concrete and needs to be treated the same way. Water can strengthen it but too much water and not enough blending can lead to problems. That is why concrete finishers do what they do when they smooth it out on top after proper mixing. And properly stick blending soap with additional water must be treated the same way."

From what you stated regarding protection from the lye mixture, as it can burn very badly, in this video, you WERE NOT even wearing gloves?? Can you explain why that is?"

Getting lye solution under your gloves makes for a very surprising event and you can't get your gloves off fast enough to rinse with water. No gloves and you can tell much sooner and safely get to water. No harm no fuss. Definitely preference.I've gotten more of a burn wearing gloves then I have without gloves.

607,Ugx-EC5KfdiomFTjA4R4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Went print out on your website BUT cancelled it ... 23  PAGES ???????Fot this??? Frankly your website was busy, cluttered, fussy and ANNOYING!Instructions: 1.  Using a digital scale, measure out the lye and water in separate glass containers.  Combine them by adding the lye to the water.  (Remember: snow floats on the lake.). Stir until the lye dissolves.  The temperature will shoot up.  Place this in a safe place to cool. 2.  While the lye solution is cooling, measure out the oils and butters and combine them in a large stainless pot.  Melt them over low heat and heat them up to 130-140 degrees.  Set them aside to cool. 3.  After 2 hours, check the temperature of both solutions.  They should be around 110 degrees.  (A range of 100-120 is fine.). If not, allow them to cool longer. 4. Prepare your mold and measure out any fragrance or color you will be adding.  (For best blending of colors, mix some color into a few drops of melted oils.). If using sodium lactate, add it to the lye water at this time. 5.  Pour the water and lye solution into the pot with the melted oils.  Blend with a stick blender until thin trace is reached.  The soap batter will noticeable thicken and a trail of soap will sit on top of the liquid rather than immediately sinking in.  (This will take about 1 minute.). Add the color and fragrance and stir by hand. 6. Immediately pour the soap batter into the mold.  Place in a turned off oven or wrap with blankets to insulate the soap. 7.  After 24 hours of curing, unmold and cut into bars.  The bars may seem slightly soft but will harden considerably during the curing process. Allow to cure at least 3 weeks in a well-ventilated place.  RESIZED 30 OUNCE BATCH for smaller molds: Almond oil: 1.46 ouncesAvocado oil: 2.92 ouncesCastor Oil: 2.92 ouncesCoconut Oil: 8.05 ouncesMango butter: 1.46 ouncesOlive Oil: 6.58 ouncesPalm Oil: 6.58 ounces Lye: 4.25 ounces Water: 7-11 ounces"

Somehow I wound up being a well known member very quickly and since I can also program they actually redesigned their banning code just for me. Now when I try to get on it only says ""We know its you iwannaaple and you are banned!"". I feel honored! Is it possible you remember me on there?Additionally, before they redesigned their code, I snook back on their and submitted a video of my lye calculator so I could ask for advice where to get information to calculate hardness and conditiong so I can put that in graph form.

Here they are:26.6 % coconut22% Olive oil22% Palm oil4.9% Almond oil9.8% Castor9.8% Avocado4.9% Mango butterSF +- 3.7%At 41 ounces of oil it will yield 10 - 5.7 ounce bars.To refit this to your mold measure (W)idth x (L)ength x (D)esired height x .40 in inches which determines oil amount only.Plug oil amount and SF 3.7% and this will approximate her recipe to your mold.Lye calculators average saponification values and might show slight variations on values. Olive oil is one of them but use the recommended lye values.

There is no control over what oil is not saponified. The only thing you can do is deduct a portion of lye. For instance, using 2.8 oz of lye will not saponify as much a 3 oz of lye. In other words, SF is what ever percentage you choose it to be and still have hard soap. If you tell me the total amount of oil that you want to use I can tell you exactly how much lye to use for this recipe."

This can be easily adjusted by using a lye/soap calculator. Input the oils/fats/butters used, as well as the amount or percentage (I prefer percentage because it is much easier to adjust the size of the batch with percentage) of each ingredient. It will calculate the water and lye required for you (the amount of water is more flexible, but the amount of lye is very important, and changes depending on the ingredients used)."

A large percent of the plant haven't been researched and could potentially cure different diseases. Don't use palm oil and protect the rainforests!

Also, it is not being cooked. The oven she put it in, has been pre-heated then turned off to keep the soap warm, to ensure a complete gel, but it is not cooking it. This is called CPOP (or Cold Process Oven Process). Hot Process would be where you are cooking the soap to accelerate Saponification by using higher amounts of heat."

Some people use bacon grease and beef tallow, but it has to be strained multiple times.  When you make soap you can technically use pretty much any butter or oil, but it. changes the property of the soap and the amount of lye you use.  You would have to run it through a lye calculator.

The important thing to look at when using someone else's recipe is to figure out if you need to increase the water as HP requires more water than CP requires. However, the 15 oz of water mentioned in this video equates to 38% water, which is recommended for Hot Process. So, yes this can be used for HP as is, without making any adjustments to the water amount."

830,Ugwt0iSLK0RnqwY641d4AaABAg.9394zUazqey95RTfu9SoiM,Ugwt0iSLK0RnqwY641d4AaABAg,It is my understanding that Lard has the very same traits as palm oil.  I've made lots of recipes replacing the Palm with Lard and I'm very pleased with the results.  Sorry if you are looking for a vegan replacement.
831,UgzMCX9XxSwfmuwRvgp4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Is there any other like you can substitute for the Palm Oil? I’m new to soap making and I keep reading bad reviews about Palm oil.
832,UgzMCX9XxSwfmuwRvgp4AaABAg.936xR8n_XNy98J5eBWr1Ep,UgzMCX9XxSwfmuwRvgp4AaABAg,Look at the World Wildlife Funds viewpoint on palm. They support the the use of sustainable palm and give their reasons why.
833,UgzMCX9XxSwfmuwRvgp4AaABAg.936xR8n_XNy937efn3Si01,UgzMCX9XxSwfmuwRvgp4AaABAg,"try babbasoa oil or tallow.  I use sustainably sourced palm oil.  you'll want to do your own research about that, it's controversial but I'm comfortable with it."
834,UgzE09rJMHRZnK8FW-R4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,This is so pretty. Can I use liquid colorants on this?
835,UgzE09rJMHRZnK8FW-R4AaABAg.92yNQlnhUa0937eaY270mv,UgzE09rJMHRZnK8FW-R4AaABAg,sure as long as they are soap safe

840,UgzPoEYTvOd6xHBamap4AaABAg.92rK0_XSwce95-npGiHBWI,UgzPoEYTvOd6xHBamap4AaABAg,giorgi lomidze no..can’t use more than 50% but that is unsafe if you accidentally splash.  Best to stay under 40%
841,UgwFblZjL5E6470oUv14AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"I appreciate ppl like you share a recipe and also provide a good demo.  however, you need to brush up on your safety precautions and set a good example.  lye can be very dangerous and you never know when something can happen or splash up.  i know a local lady who got a little splash in her eye, and it looked like her eye was going to fall out.  SO RED for weeks.  its not worth the risk. she was someone who made it all the time and thought hey im good enough that i dont need goggles and gloves.  she almost went blind."

I was just reading something about how lumberjacks often have serious accidents when they are more experienced because they get overly confident and don't take all the precautions they should.  I'll start wearing goggles at least  emoji_winking_face "

845,UgyNbF5hwuudGbb9thZ4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Yes what a well balanced recipe keeping that coconut oil under 25% helps too emoji_winking_face Thank You I will test it out emoji_smiling_face_with_open_hands 
846,UgxqrY85n6feFnIGapp4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Thanks for the recipe. Can cocoa butter be used in place of mango butter? If not, what would you suggest? I would like to try this recipe."
847,UgxqrY85n6feFnIGapp4AaABAg.92c-sztow2S92eq9C4pII9,UgxqrY85n6feFnIGapp4AaABAg,@Heart's Content Farmhouse I plan in checking it. Thanks for your reply.
848,UgxqrY85n6feFnIGapp4AaABAg.92c-sztow2S92eZBfjciL0,UgxqrY85n6feFnIGapp4AaABAg,they have similar properties so it should work.  just be sure to run through a lye calculator first :)
849,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,If you would like to resize this to fit your own mold you will need percentages. Here they are:26.6 % coconut22% Olive oil22% Palm oil4.9% Almond oil9.8% Castor9.8% Avocado4.9% Mango butterSF +- 3.7%At 41 ounces of oil it will yield 10 - 5.7 ounce bars.To refit this to your mold measure (W)idth x (L)ength x (D)esired height x .40 in inches which determines oil amount only.Plug oil amount and SF 3.7% and this will approximate her recipe to your mold.Lye calculators average saponification values and might show slight variations on values. Olive oil is one of them but use the recommended lye values.
850,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg.92atYGmScgl951qRSOovdc,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg,"@Debbie Escobar Yep, people do that. In my case I just use oils that don't saponify as fast OR I might use more water but in some cases it seems to me that it speeds things up. I have done the same recipe at times with different amounts of water and it seemed that it behaved better with less water so you never know. But anyway, Using my lye calculator is how I figured out the above percentages of oils. If she would have used percentages it would have helped you out for your mold. So I posted them."
851,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg.92atYGmScgl950xhDEpIx7,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg,"iwannaapple I think lye percentage is a personal preference.  For a complicated design I will bump it up to help fluidity, for example."
852,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg.92atYGmScgl950QlxePEL9,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg,@Debbie Escobar It does help. The only reason I can figure it out is because I made my own lye calculator so its quite easy for me. But a lot of soapers might be lost if you don't include information like that.I even made a couple of videos about it. Comes in handy for many things.
853,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg.92atYGmScgl95-p2pFeS9X,UgxPkx-HJ5uFL9MCFWd4AaABAg,"iwannaapple yeah, I wish ppl would use percentages...we all have different molds...also it eliminates the issue with typos."
854,UgzYe_AlfM6VWr7gI-p4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,New to soap making where can I purchase a soap making kit for a beginner
855,UgzYe_AlfM6VWr7gI-p4AaABAg.92YjV6VoRi292bh5i79IaE,UgzYe_AlfM6VWr7gI-p4AaABAg,"You'll probably save money by just buying some basic oils from the market, lye and distilled water.  Basic oils would be coconut, olive (I use classic), sunflower, castor oil(use no more than 5%).  Go to soapcalc.net and make your recipe. There's a gal on here who makes it very simple to learn to use the soap calculator.  You can even make a very basic soap with lye, distilled water and lard...just like grandma used to make."
856,UgwarfjEJN4naxdrZUx4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,Good for face?  I wanna make decorative soaps for gifts.  With proper mold. It can be down with this correct? Shapes for grandchildren

860,UgywecFJ2hJUbTT2eEJ4AaABAg.92Ml3TZYoKp95-poIW2YYB,UgywecFJ2hJUbTT2eEJ4AaABAg,WARNING!!  Soapmaking is highly addictive!!

868,Ugx6OQNxiZnbTwNGauR4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"Everything sounds great and I'm going to try this but PLEASE DON'T use palm oil. PLEASE RECOMMEND something else. Palm oil production is what' causing mass deforestation. Rain forests are burned to clear the land for palm oil trees.and many animals are burnt with it. Those that do not burn to death are left without homes. Endangered species are dying and becoming extinct because of this. The Sumatran Rhino was declared extinct in the wild in Malaysia. The number of Sumatran rhinos has dropped an estimated 70 percent in the past two decades. Sumatran tigers, Pygmy elephants, Sun bears, orangutans, and many more animals are on the verge of extinction. Not even ""sustainable palm oil"" is actually sustainable and only about 30% less deforestation. Two countries are responsible for 90 percent of the world’s palm oil production: Malaysia and Indonesia. In those places, children as young as 8 and 9 sometimes work seven days a week in treacherous conditions. People are lured to faraway plantations thinking they'll get fair wages. They do not and are essentially paid pennies per day. I know this is long but it's so important for everyone to know. Palm oil is nearly everywhere. It’s in tortilla chips, a cheap way to add oil and maintain texture. It’s in shaving cream, helping it stay creamy. Palm oil is in soap, microwave meals, doughnuts, and cookies. The great panoply of processed goods that fill the center aisles in most American grocery stores are dominated by palm oil. We need to make sure products do not contain palm oil before we purchase then. https://www.rainforest-rescue.org/petitions/914/orangutans-victims-of-sustainable-palm-oil https://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/put-down-the-palm-oil-planet-friendly-alternatives-for-your-home/"

930,Ugw1GMHWvbT3cFhyLqp4AaABAg,e4VU8onoc9E,"I'm just now reading books and getting my center. I haven't made one lick of soap yet.  So my question is; if one were to use scented oils instead of powdered fragrance, how would that change the finished product?"
931,Ugw1GMHWvbT3cFhyLqp4AaABAg.91jUDIP79yv91k8Wflzujd,Ugw1GMHWvbT3cFhyLqp4AaABAg,@Heart's Content Farmhouse Awesome. Thank you for the help. :)
932,Ugw1GMHWvbT3cFhyLqp4AaABAg.91jUDIP79yv91jc0W6Gq4Y,Ugw1GMHWvbT3cFhyLqp4AaABAg,"Scented oils are fine, if they are labeled that they can be used for cold process soap.  The thing is... each affects the batter differently.  They will often make the batter get thick very quickly, or even “rice” where it forms lumps.  Floral fragrances are especially bad at this.  You have to check each fragrance.  Essential oils don’t really “stick” in the soap, the scent just fades away."

Do you turn the oven on low. Or just let it stay in that enclosed environment to keep it warm while it goes thru gel phase?  Thank you for sharing your recipe and knowledge
978,UgzYExk1Y7sHgjjOVPp4AaABAg.91J4Toix-hn91JarsgI5_k,UgzYExk1Y7sHgjjOVPp4AaABAg,"hi!  Yes,, I'm sorry about that!  You turn the oven to 100-140 degrees, and put the soap it.  You let it sit in there with the oven on for 1 hour.  Turn off the heat, but don't open the door or disturb the soap.  It sits in there for a total of 24 hours.  This helps intensify the colors and speed up the chemical reaction.  But it's optional!   If you don't have an oven to spare for the day, you can wrap it in a lot of old blankets  emoji_smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes "

I also usually do not add the whole water content at first until it cools down, unlike most shows in videos.  anything i add to the lye, i add it AFTER it cools down.

I'm taking part in a YouTube soap collaboration on Sunday this week (1st March 2020) so I will be uploading another video then. Please leave any comments below, I'd love to know what you feel about whether to add an intro to the video or not, what do you prefer, do you like an intro or would you prefer to just get straight into the soap making.

1073,UgwlDx9GNBJjB4tV_Hl4AaABAg,Ge-ohkbEwQU,Why did you calculate the fragrance percentage by oil weight instead of total soap weight? Do you always calculate the percentage by oil weight and not soap weight or was that something unique to this batch?
1074,UgwlDx9GNBJjB4tV_Hl4AaABAg.9AH4iSgfVRw9AHxNIBiPgR,UgwlDx9GNBJjB4tV_Hl4AaABAg,"@I Dream In Soap I have no regrets at all! Now, I know more than I did before and that actually makes perfect sense. Thank you so much for answering my question.  emoji_smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes "
1075,UgwlDx9GNBJjB4tV_Hl4AaABAg.9AH4iSgfVRw9AHF18sd5Ai,UgwlDx9GNBJjB4tV_Hl4AaABAg,"Hi Imani. Using oil weight is a more accurate way of calculating the fragrance. If you use total soap weight then the % of fragrance in your bars will effectively increase as the water cures out. Now most of the time it's a matter of preference and if you always use the same recipe with the same amount of water then it will not make a lot of difference, apart from using total soap weight will give you more fragrance and therefore a stronger scent.Where it is a problem is if you are using a fragrance oil where the IFRA safe usage limit is low, now some of them have a safe usage of 10% or even more, so basically you would never exceed that anyway as the fragrance would be far too strong. Lets say you had a max safe rate of 5% (which is very common), that is the maximum that it is safe to have in your FINISHED product, So if your recipe is 1000g in total and of that 70% is oil the rest is lye and water (I'm ignoring other additives for simplicity). If you use 5% of the total you would a 50g of fragrance, 5% of oils you would use 35g. When your bars have cured they will have lost most of the water and be much closer to the oil weight (I'll go through likely weight in a minute) So let's imagine they loose all that extra weight, you will now have 50g of fragrance in 700g of soap, you now have 7.1% of fragrance oil in your finished bar, which exceeds the IFRA safe maximum usage.Look at me going on :-)……… It has been studied and proven that the typical bar after curing ends up being, the oil weight, plus weight of the dry lye plus 10% of the water, as it doesn't all cure out, so if we did the math on that, for a normal sort of recipe you would end up with your soap batch weighing about 810g (approx.) So in theory the max amount of fragrance you could safely have would be 40g, not the 50g you would put in if you used the total soap weight.In the UK we are only ever allowed a maximum of 3% fragrance (or less if the IFRA limit is lower). So I actually work mine out as 3.49% of oil as that then takes account of the oil, lye and remaining water weight.Hope this helps (you probably wished you'd never asked - if you're still reading :-)  )Lisa xx"

It's funny quite a few people say they like the maths, I was a bit unsure about putting it in, but there's always a fast forward button for people who don't want it. Thank you  :-)"

I like to try to explain what's going on in my head, but sometimes wonder if people think - come on just get on with it. I guess they can always fast forward.  It's great to have feedback, thanks for that"
1111,UgwT1ZoighHnL8_LqY14AaABAg,Ge-ohkbEwQU,"Thanks for the tutorial! I tend to just use the same size recipe and use the leftovers for my small molds. It's my way of sneaking some extra soap for myself  emoji_rolling_on_the_floor_laughing    Of course if I regularly had extra, I might not be able to justify the extra batter all the time. I really need to try a confetti soap soon. Yours is so pretty and fun. I love the colors!  emoji_smiling_face_with_heart-eyes "
1112,UgwT1ZoighHnL8_LqY14AaABAg.95ffcgkKpSP97nOgBdMlBi,UgwT1ZoighHnL8_LqY14AaABAg,You have excelent soaps too. I subscribe too.
1113,UgwT1ZoighHnL8_LqY14AaABAg.95ffcgkKpSP95gYzB6VnWO,UgwT1ZoighHnL8_LqY14AaABAg,"Thank you so much Whittany, I guess I find I just don't want the extra soap as we have plenty (not selling yet)  Also when I do a confetti soap, as I'm using up scraps I really don't want to make any extra and generate more surplus. Hopefully when I start selling I'll need the extras"
1114,UgwPVYLfisIWgIP20k54AaABAg,Ge-ohkbEwQU,"My first thought when I saw this soap was it is too simple a design for your talent. But in reality, the amount of math required for your level of precision is not simple at all. I will be referring back to this tutorial. I appreciate you writing all out. I love math/ I'm just not as good at it as I'd like to be.  emoji_smirking_face  Thank you. A lovely soap. I do rather like the straight to the soap w/o intro."

Sometimes it's nice to do a simple soap, just chill out and do something that doesn't take hours (also I hate having scraps around) Also as my videos are more of the tutorial type I feel if I put up some less complicated soaps as well then some people may feel that they would like to have a go at making something similar themselves, as you said as it was quite simple I tried to add an extra 'tutorial element' to it."
1116,Ugx3UTRPwcn2mC6g0nd4AaABAg,Ge-ohkbEwQU,Love it! I have yet to do a confetti soap but you have inspired me to do a confetti soap. I will make sure to share it on my channel once I make it. Thanks again for a wonderful video! Keep up all these lovely designs.

My favorite part is when you say ""Come on, let's make some soap"" ... It makes me smile  emoji_smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes . BUT if you don't really like making them, then don't feel obligated  emoji_two_hearts This soap is fantastic in every way. Beautiful color choices! And wonderful job explaining things.-Shonna"

I like the intros but actually find them more difficult to film (lighting / set up etc) that the rest. I think as long as I have something valid to say I'll do them but not just for the sake of putting one on. So pleased you like the soap :-)"

I generally just mix everything and pour off what I need and hope it doesn’t thicken ...which hardly ever works.  Lol"

I wasn't sure if that's exactly what you wanted or whether it was how to calculate how much you need when you have more complicated designs, like my Saturn or transforming tree soaps etc, but I'll keep it in mind then next time I do one and add a bit of that detail."
1144,UgzHuctGNyZv1v4ppRB4AaABAg,Ge-ohkbEwQU,Thanks for the efforts to explain the calculations.

I have been looking at a lot of commercial bar soap manufacturers who generally use glycerin, which is essentially a type of plant based oil so what's the difference if I use Glycerin instead of other food grade oils like olive, palm, or coconut. Is there a difference, what are the pros and cons?"

1175,UgyXwJCrgkv3KuyE99x4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,Which one is best KOH OR NAOH???
1176,UgyXwJCrgkv3KuyE99x4AaABAg.9k_EQ3o6uNA9lKXYx_DPjG,UgyXwJCrgkv3KuyE99x4AaABAg,NAOH (sodium hydroxide) is used for bar soap and KOH (potassium hydroxide) is used for liquid soap! The both are awesome at what they do.
1177,UgzNLieRdZyIQbdP3vF4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,How do you get nice colors...mine are often dull and miscolored because the original color is a creamy instead of white so my colors are often off a little

While making it I faced two problems:-I melted stearic acid in oils then poured lye solution then added sodium lactate and then finally blended it. It reached a very thick trace. On pouring it in the mould it didn't properly settle in it. Upon un-moulding it today the shape of the soap is not good. Please let me know where did I go wrong  emoji_loudly_crying_face Secondly, for the color I added Pink french clay. Despite adding it in a good amount it didn't impart a substantial level of color in the soap. Please guide me  emoji_folded_hands "
1182,UgyoivpyyknIwEZMGCV4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,So I get you can't go in reverse if you over-trace but then what?! Is the soap salvageable? Can you just quickly dump/pour/scoop it into a mold?

I'm interested specifically in Lye, I didn't understand how much I'm getting for the price of $11.99?  I see it says ""1-32 oz jar = $11.99.""  Does that mean that for $11.99 = 32 oz (1kg)?"

In a video telling people common mistakes in soapmaking, you've told people to make another common mistake in soapmaking  emoji_grimacing_face  people - please do not lick your soap! You want to do the zap test safety by taking a wet finger to your soap at least 2 days after making for CP or once hard for HP and creating a bit of lather to touch to the tip of your touch. Also, if you don't know what biting on a filling feels like - a zap is unmistakably a zap. You can't miss it. It feels like a ""zzzzzing!"" on your tongue. As opposed to just tasting gross.

Super from Latin meaning above or more than. As in using more  fat than called for in the recipe. But despite that she used 100% coconut oil in the soap, it would be very drying on the skin none the less."
1229,UgwNqUw1FwzzDTlFH5l4AaABAg.9gtENB0Oe3W9kqXFWxbaiW,UgwNqUw1FwzzDTlFH5l4AaABAg,@Sunshine Pearl stop confusing yourself. Super fatting adds oil to the soap that won't saponify. My comment was directed to  justine justice.

1242,UgxZQ0Dyrsiof9csnjd4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,"Actually, if the soap is completely cured (stops losing weight), you can definitely vacuum pack a cold or hot processed soap with oxygen absorber packet. There’s a big retail company who sells only cold processed soap of 20 different kinds and they do vacuum pack their soap. No DOS as it’s already cured and they test their packaging and the best before date in a commercial lab. It may not be the best way to package for relatively newer soaps, but if the soap has enough time to cure, like 6-8 months, you can keep the freshness of the soap including the scent retention of vacuum sealed with exact size of oxygen absorbing packet. I’ve used their soaps before and it keeps it fresh. It extends the life of soaps because some soaps with higher SF may go rancid in two years. It extends the life of soaps. Same concept that oil you get is vacuum sealed or sometimes nitrogen flushed and sealed, which allows you to keep the freshness of an oil for a few years IF unopened. It’s quite common in cosmetic luxury type soaps to package like that. Definitely no DOS by packaging vacuum sealed, as they’re tested multiple times in the lab to guarantee expiry date (we have much more strict laws here than in the US for cosmetics and soaps are cosmetics here)."
1243,UgxZQ0Dyrsiof9csnjd4AaABAg.9gkHboUsL1f9kB4zpkewO2,UgxZQ0Dyrsiof9csnjd4AaABAg,"If the soap is fully cured, there is absolutely no need for a moisture absorber or vacuum sealing of the soap.  It will last decades if made properly.   Absorbers, with indercured soap, promote warping.  No method, madmade or otherwise, speeds up the cure process (1) saponification, 2) water evaporation, and 3) crystallization."

It was really nice and having a scent that also colored the soap was really helpful. I've done 4 batches since then, two with the lots of lather oil mix, though i did stripes with them, and then two that i mixed the oils myself. I did have a minor failure when i tried to use a 12 cavity mold for the first time rather than a loaf mold because i tried to stripe it and it got too stiff. The soap works fine, but it doesn't look as nice as any of my other batches.I did have a bit of an issue with my most recent batch of trying to incorporate a small amount of shea butter to my oil and fat mixture. I managed eventually and it was only about 5% of the mixture, but there's probably an easier way to do it"

1260,UgxTgltdhpRqlvogezd4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,"Fragrance recipes can change over time due to availability of ingredients too! Just because a fragrance worked for you perfectly last year, getting a new bottle of it and using it this year doesn't always mean it will soap the same way. I've had one bottle work perfectly, then next time I bought it, it seized up and was unusable. Definitely check reviews! Sometimes those can let you learn from another person's discovery about a fragrance changing. Just keep in mind that some oils work with some fragrances. If you don't use the same oils as someone who reported seizing did, you might have a different result and it'll work fine! If one person reports ricing or seizing, it could be due to temperature or oil recipe or something else entirely. Soapmaking is a constant battle of trying to wakeboard. Too fast or slow and things go wrong... but when you get that sweet spot that works for you, you really do have fun with it! It's a science and an art all in one!"

I was smart enough to stay away from trying intricate designs tho!I know you don't specialize in hot process soap but I noticed your fragrances don't mention how it interacts with this method.

If you want the soap to go through gel phase, place the mold on a heating pad and insulate.

If the recipe has a lot of firm butters (cocoa butter, for example) it will be more likely to crack. High temperatures can also cause soap to crack. Try decreasing your soaping temperatures first, then consider tweaking your recipe."

1285,UgyPLdfZYH-BxbqNLlp4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,"Thank you so much you are an inspiration. I bought a soap kit and the instructions said to let the lye solution reach room temperature before making soap (which is about 72 degrees),  and my soap top came out very ashy and I couldn’t understand why."
1286,Ugy3oelmgY8FKrJO4Sp4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,"I learned on Soap Queen, years ago, lol! I did make a plain batch for my first with one color. I've never regretted that. Now I do all the complicated swirls and layers, but I now prefer a plain bar of soap, lol! I think everyone eventually comes full circle, if you started out with a basic bar. There's something really pure about a plain bar of soap. Ok with just a bit of goats milk, lol! It's great on the skin and simple to make and clean up afterwards! Yeah, less dishes. I'm all for that!Jill Gross"

1288,Ugy-x1fqfIDqw6ms7YF4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,With all respect have to disagree with you on the colorants. When working with pigments a little bit can be too much. I ruined  beautiful batch of soap many years ago
1289,Ugy-x1fqfIDqw6ms7YF4AaABAg.9gXlsEkpIG69gXui-oB5jL,Ugy-x1fqfIDqw6ms7YF4AaABAg,"You're right, you can definitely use too much and negatively affect your batch of soap. In this instance, we were clarifying that we don't usually measure colorants by weight in our recipes. We usually list the amount used as teaspoons and tablespoons, because we use such small amounts."
1290,UgzKnUl7hDmvxJcQ8ed4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,Thank you.

My first batch went  well, besides two mistakes. I chose a floral (there were no testing notes from the company I chose) not knowing that they can seize like mad. So of course, I stick blended the life outa my soap then added the fragrance... YIKES! My second mistake was that I wanted round bars, so I used a piece of PVC, and didn't secure the bottom well enough.

1301,UgxGL7OSyzJo-JvJwiV4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,My very first batch of soap I made back in March and it was a three colored layered soap with rosemary and lemon. It turned out beautifully. I have been addicted since and have gotten up to doing very intricate designs and doing soap frosting as well.
1302,UgxGL7OSyzJo-JvJwiV4AaABAg.9gXFLTvyGa69gXOSLhzv7a,UgxGL7OSyzJo-JvJwiV4AaABAg,@Bramble Berry it was actually done with one of your guys CP beginners kits. Oh and my husband is absolutely addicted to the apple sage and the apple bourbon fragrance oil. He’s a marine so he’s picky about his scents  emoji_face_with_tears_of_joy  but he really seems to love your apple ones.
1303,UgxGL7OSyzJo-JvJwiV4AaABAg.9gXFLTvyGa69gXLM39GXGI,UgxGL7OSyzJo-JvJwiV4AaABAg,Sounds like a beautiful batch of soap!

1314,Ugx-M4LHJeFoGM5R8BV4AaABAg,OCk2q8HNiH0,"Hey I made my first batch three weeks ago, I was so confused why it got trace early and it got a bit hard with 3 colors no fragrance. I guess it’s the Shea butter and mango butter  emoji_grinning_face_with_sweat . I’m based in South Africa  emoji_South_Africa "
1315,Ugx-M4LHJeFoGM5R8BV4AaABAg.9gX8gvbgsbP9gXYJNweVCc,Ugx-M4LHJeFoGM5R8BV4AaABAg,"When I use butters in my soap, I usually soap closer to 120-130F (48-54C), because butters have a higher melting point than even typical hard oils (coconut, babassu, palm) or animal fats (lard, tallow). That helps a lot. I love using cocoa butter in my recipes and I can usually keep my batter pretty fluid even though I usually use babassu or palm kernel flakes in combination with cocoa butter."
1316,Ugx-M4LHJeFoGM5R8BV4AaABAg.9gX8gvbgsbP9gX9rxodpQG,Ugx-M4LHJeFoGM5R8BV4AaABAg,"A high percentage of butters in your recipe can definitely speed up trace, making your soap batter very thick.

1335,UgyQUNlyIXlkjd6PMKt4AaABAg,SnMrQTcPDIc,You make it look so easy! Thanks for sharing. I am wondering if all that oil used to make the soap contributes to clogging up drains. Hopefully there is some kind of chemical reaction (probably the lye) in the mixing that prevents it.
1336,UgyQUNlyIXlkjd6PMKt4AaABAg.9iiRYKUcr0m9klWzBkYvYm,UgyQUNlyIXlkjd6PMKt4AaABAg,Adding a chelator like citric acid or sodium citrate to the soap batter would eliminate a lot of soap scum.

Thank you for your beautiful work. I am also intrigued by the beautiful coffee soap you made with the higher water content with cocoa powder, and the rivers. These videos are so relaxing to me.
