6,UgzW4SIBuXhFYyTftCx4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Beautiful!
7,UgxjpxBkWVq-pNcPix14AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Do you put your molds into the oven or let them sit room temperature  after pouring?
8,UgxjpxBkWVq-pNcPix14AaABAg.9kxQsjnl_k89kxR4MGpWLI,UgxjpxBkWVq-pNcPix14AaABAg,I used to put them in the oven but my food started to taste like chemicals so I stopped. Now I put a lid on it and cover with a towel on my counter :)
9,Ugw54bX-6tOerD-WbVl4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,"No hype no ""gotta have soap love"" phoney stuff. Just a great production.  emoji_sunrise  emoji_bathtub "
10,Ugyj5sW4V2F6qD7CiYp4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,So pretty!! And creative!!
11,UgzGehEZyaqb3XMblAF4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,What is the name of the white powder that you poured into jars?
12,Ugw4bJLak6ooQyHRRw94AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,"I watch all your videos and I'm just gonna go out on a limb here and say if you were a cake decorator in a former life.  emoji_grinning_face_with_sweat I am a baker/cake decorator and I know you had to be at some point. I switched my attention to soap a few years ago but I am still a cake decorator for income. I really don't enjoy anything about it anymore and trying to get a soap business going. Been doing it way too long. You're videos are amazing, btw. I watch them just to chill myself out. Thank you so much for your channel. Much love to you."
13,UgyHjk8wdtbh2t3RTLN4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,I think you've done this a time or two before.
14,UgyDxG7F4nycJg10AJt4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,How do you keep your base liquid? Mine turns to pudding quickly and won't pour. Especially after sitting.
15,UgyDxG7F4nycJg10AJt4AaABAg.9kK16zj6zI59kLX2fp_QoT,UgyDxG7F4nycJg10AJt4AaABAg,What temperature do you soap at? I try to not over mix in the beginning and mix my color with with a whisk. And add my fragrance to each container instead of all at once. As long as the fragrance behaves. It should stay fluid :)
16,UgxYFtma8j4m82v49U14AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,"I am living in  Gwagwalada, Abuja.  I will  appreciate if you can help me to get them  or direct me to  where I can get them  I.e  the mould,cutters and the silicon  moulds.Thank  you in anticipation  for your  favourable  response."

20,UgyhHLp-7MzAYtaeGl94AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Beautiful. After how many minutes you poured the second layer?
21,UgyhHLp-7MzAYtaeGl94AaABAg.9jjr6ZTGP-Z9jk2e3deRr_,UgyhHLp-7MzAYtaeGl94AaABAg,Between 5-20. Depending on how much I was able to blend it. The more I get to blend the more set up it will be :)
22,Ugy0gXcoKZPVkRoNjBt4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Absolutely beautiful  emoji_smiling_face_with_heart-eyes   emoji_star-struck   emoji_OK_hand   emoji_red_heart   emoji_heart_suit

24,UgwiNdLV8bro3a8AJUZ4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Масло и щелоч разных температур? Получается от того что щелочь горячая она растворила масла?
25,UgyIzvhYSyaGQKZGnjx4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Awesome! I love it!
26,UgzXRyWB_wV9GBklckh4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,"Awesome soap. Please tell me which blueberry fragrance you use I get mine from candle science I LOVE the scent, but it turns my soaps brown from the vanillin. Thank you."
27,UgzXRyWB_wV9GBklckh4AaABAg.9hpETCa550r9hpQJLQd_ia,UgzXRyWB_wV9GBklckh4AaABAg,It’s called Blueberry from Natures Garden :)
28,UgxW2QTXXmkIGGcHdOh4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,something about any soap with the word blueberry in the title. Thanks for sharing
29,UgxcmSaRCmYEFoZFV3Z4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,"I love the vines, leaves and blueberries on the top, it is a work of art."
30,UgyzP1QsZ4XDS-IEyvR4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,"Hi, are your bars 2 inches in depth? I am trying to cut my tall bars similar to the ones I have purchased from you,everytime I say I'm going to save it so the next time I make soap I have a visual....I can't resist and end up using  it !"
31,UgyzP1QsZ4XDS-IEyvR4AaABAg.9h89uDO67Fy9h8g-4TqJk0,UgyzP1QsZ4XDS-IEyvR4AaABAg,I cut them 1.5” in depth and they are a little over 2” wide
32,Ugyzq6otihizNyVymXV4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,The top is to die for! I love dark colors and the contrast of the blueberries and the leaves is absolutely stunning!
33,UgxfzNUcPLei8PZ-4tF4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Which mold you are using?
34,UgxfzNUcPLei8PZ-4tF4AaABAg.9gXEGmAmi2t9gXO0gKdfgh,UgxfzNUcPLei8PZ-4tF4AaABAg,It’s linked in the description box :)
35,UgyEOFpWCG_0R6h53ih4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Very nice emoji_star-struck  emoji_smiling_face_with_heart-eyes 
36,Ugyt_IVEID-jgYPAUxV4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Hi thanks for getting back to me so quickly I am just getting into soap.. Your soap is OUTSTANDING!  I have a question do you always have to use lie in order for to fluff up.?  Can I ask you what is the purpose of the white powder is it to make like the goats milk soap whiter when you put in oils or fragrance I’m really not sure.
37,UgxH07iksie5e7jrIr14AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Hello that was really cool. What was the white product you put into the mix? What brand of colors do you use.  emoji_sunflower 
38,UgxH07iksie5e7jrIr14AaABAg.9f7YLFRx66P9f7hv6u3YkB,UgxH07iksie5e7jrIr14AaABAg,It’s a white colorant called titanium dioxide. I have where I get my colorants linked in the description box :)
39,UgxyS7SnRrONZa9GUZ14AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Very beautiful. Are you using oil base colorant?
40,Ugwm_ESpkVrxIuimAqx4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Song?
41,UgwHOBTjld5CybnGBaZ4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,You are one of my favorite soap makers!  I wish we could make soap together!
42,UgxTcVGvwfmi6NyQWnp4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,I think I smell blueberries just watching!  emoji_beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes 
43,UgxkMlWjMGvvvMzbApR4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,I love this soap looks delicious
44,UgzUoxLApRQAfKVFGwd4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,I was wondering if there is any emulsification (if that's a word) that happens while melting the oils with the lye and all that stirring
45,UgzUoxLApRQAfKVFGwd4AaABAg.9el76DJhcOR9er88R3NAXP,UgzUoxLApRQAfKVFGwd4AaABAg,@Ophelia’s Soapery thank you
46,UgzUoxLApRQAfKVFGwd4AaABAg.9el76DJhcOR9elLS_j72ex,UgzUoxLApRQAfKVFGwd4AaABAg,A tiny bit. But It will stay fluid for a very long time until you use a stick blender.
47,Ugyg7eU2QOl881h-3w14AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Absolutely beautiful! What did you use tô make the leaves and fruits on top of the soap?
48,Ugyg7eU2QOl881h-3w14AaABAg.9eZLeO-r3p99eaNaE3ntGl,Ugyg7eU2QOl881h-3w14AaABAg,I used a leaf piping tip and a small round piping tip :)
49,UgwzVYzMMIWr10eQUYh4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Can you tell me if you use Extra Virgin Olive Oil or Olive Pomace Oil? Which one is better when making soap?
50,UgwzVYzMMIWr10eQUYh4AaABAg.9eVCF05N9PE9ehAUG8aUI3,UgwzVYzMMIWr10eQUYh4AaABAg,@Ophelia’s Soapery thank you
51,UgwzVYzMMIWr10eQUYh4AaABAg.9eVCF05N9PE9eW7-QmJYyL,UgwzVYzMMIWr10eQUYh4AaABAg,I use regular olive oil. Extra virgin tends to be too green and pomace tends to accelerate trace faster.
52,UgwqBfJ6Pv22FFW5vcV4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Beautiful!
53,UgwvjVJ5KdUTOPg8SUJ4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,These are just beautiful!
54,UgzXNtnpwplhOzSjQcR4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Your soaps are the bomb!  You make it look so easy.  Just curious what piping tip you use to make the vines and leaves.  Thanks!
55,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg,qm-BlHAPS_8,Is there any difference in the final product using the lye solution to melt the hard oils vs melting them separately and blending when they are close in temperature?
56,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg.9eRNYRSTW_L9eXmWqQYdIA,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg,Yes you are correct. My batch size needs 8.25 oz of fragrance and I had 8oz. It worked out perfectly :)Once you do it a thousand times you get a feel for how much each container needs  emoji_smiling_face_with_hearts 
57,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg.9eRNYRSTW_L9eX3ngy41j3,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg,"@Ophelia’s Soapery so you add all your oils together, soft and hard, then pour your hot lye water. That's what it looked like. Also I'm impressed with your eyeballing the scent measurments"
58,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg.9eRNYRSTW_L9eSEorlspc6,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg,Yes it absolutely is. If you want to soap right away and didn’t prep your lye or melt your oils down. Heat transfer method lets you soap right away.
59,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg.9eRNYRSTW_L9eS46SaV43J,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg,@Ophelia’s Soapery Thanks for answering.  I guess it's just a personal preference.
60,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg.9eRNYRSTW_L9eRipI1VXcI,UgydBBA75uvtbjNpvmx4AaABAg,Not at all :)
