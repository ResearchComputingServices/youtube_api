Until four years the pantheon still had its god statues and firence was a beautifull place. Ever heard of the ships of the gods that sailed a lake and were a temple for the gods well as the colloseum(that was a theatre, no fights ever occoured there) stood all intact untill 5 years ago. Ihave to repeat that the invention of the vatican is only four years old and was never a reality. Only propagated by a shitty group of assholes that made shit movies and shat the  media full with lies. May the gods bewith you"

It may have happened 10,000 years ago, or maybe even 3,000 years ago, but at some point in time, it seems the odds are that it happened.     There was likely nothing at all fair about life, until just recently.   I would even say that everyone then had PTSD, or some effect from it all.     It would be so fascinating to have a time-machine and go back to the time when homo sapiens had never heard of the myths that people cherish today.

It takes the myth and brings a practicality to the story. Like if it is true or even buts and pieces of it are true, this is what it would have looked like. Nothing supernatural about it, just men, women and children trying to figure it out way back then.Brutal yet honest alongside gorgeous cinematography makes this one a real stunner. It is in old Latin I think which; kudos to the actors- what an amazing job- so yes subtitles all throughout. But man oh man is it worth a go. At the very end you are on the edge of your seat waiting for him to say it- ROME! Brilliant movie! Check it out!"

When I watched ""The Passion"", the actors spoke classical Latin (a bit in a mechanical way, actually). I was able to follow the dialogs with the help of subtitles and some memory of High School...  It was not the case with this ""First King"" because the actors speak fluently (so, quickly); probably they made a lot of training. And the archaisms did the rest. I understood only simple sentences such as ""soli sumus"" (we are alone) or ""neca!"" (kill). During the viewing I also realized that some pronounciations were a bit different from what I remembered (ignis - fire - was spelled ig-nis with g and n separated, and not like in ""sign"", for example)"

Therefore, in an Italian movie about the founding of Rome, they originally title it ""Il primo re"" translated as ""The First King"" but is also renamed as ""Romulus & Remus: The First King (2019)"" on IMDB as well, which further helps to contextualize the title of ""The First King"" moniker.

355,UgiAhWgLWmI-tngCoAEC,6zSE40oXT-Q,"Fun historical tidbit: Rome probably predates the Romans, and was likely ruled by Etruscans first, basically a separate group of ancient Italians.  The killing of Remus may have been related to an Etruscan tradition about walls being built a certain way--specifically that jumping over a wall breaks a spell, the one who jumped the wall must be sacrificed to restore the protective magic.  Romulus and Remus may have been even more clearly 'Cain and Abel' types, their myth could have been an explanation of a gruesome sacrificial tradition carried out to protect the sanctity of city walls. (I guess the 'Fun' part is debatable huh?)"
